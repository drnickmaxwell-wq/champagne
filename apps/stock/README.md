# Stock app

Purpose
- Keep a simple, shared record of stock in clinic storage.
- Track what comes in, what goes out, and what needs ordering.

Baseline day procedure (Monday)
- Start in the main cupboard and finish it before moving on.
- Then do Surgery 1, then Surgery 2, then secondary storage.
- Scan items and set the starting level for the week.
- Record batch and expiry for medicines and the emergency kit.
- For composites, record batch and expiry if practical.
- Use notes only when something needs extra clarity.

Daily use procedure
- Scan when you receive stock.
- Scan when you withdraw stock.
- Use adjust only when a count is wrong and you can explain why.
- Keep updates small and frequent.
- Finish with a quick scan of the reorder list.

How to scan (QR or barcode)
- Open the scanner in the app.
- Point at the QR or barcode until it beeps.
- Pick the right action: Receive, Withdraw, or Adjust.
- Enter the quantity and save.

What RECEIVE, WITHDRAW, ADJUST mean
- RECEIVE: Stock has arrived and is now in the cupboard.
- WITHDRAW: Stock has been taken out for use or disposal.
- ADJUST: Fix a count error with a short reason.

How reorder works
- Reorder shows items below their minimum level.
- You can only reorder what is on the list.
- After delivery, use Receive to clear the shortfall.

If something looks wrong
- Stop and re-scan the item.
- Check the label and location.
- If it still looks wrong, use Adjust with a clear reason.
- Tell the lead on duty before the end of the session.

Do not do
- Do not do a full recount every day.
- Do not guess quantities.
- Do not skip scanning because you are busy.
