# Stock App — Staff Usage Guide

## What this app is
This is an internal stock tracking tool.
It records stock movements (receive, withdraw, adjust) and calculates reorder needs.
It does not rely on patient data.

## First-time setup (baseline day)
1. Start in the main stock cupboard
2. For each product, count what is physically present
3. Use RECEIVE to enter the quantity
4. Add batch number and expiry where applicable
5. Do this once only

## Daily use
- WITHDRAW when stock is taken
- RECEIVE when deliveries arrive
- ADJUST only to correct mistakes or expired items

## Scanning
- Scan a QR code to identify:
  - a location
  - a product
  - or a batch
- If raw data appears, select the relevant action panel

## Reorder page
- Shows items below minimum levels
- Suggested quantities are based on defined min/max levels
- Use RECEIVE to log new deliveries

## What NOT to do
- Do not re-count everything daily
- Do not invent quantities
- Do not ignore expired stock

## If something looks wrong
- Use ADJUST
- Or tell Nicko
