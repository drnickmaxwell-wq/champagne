## 1. Purpose

This canon governs how emotional states translate into lighting, HDR behaviour, weather layers, and cinematic ambience across the Champagne Ecosystem.  
It defines how *feelings* become *light* across:

- Home hero  
- Treatment pages  
- Veneer/Aligner/Implant 3D viewers  
- Portal journeys  
- Concierge conversational scenes  

Lighting never overwhelms. It only guides, softens, reassures, or celebrates.

## 4. Cinematic Behaviours

- All lighting respects gradient law (135°).
- softGold highlights capped at ≤4%.
- Every emotional preset must support prefers-reduced-motion with fade/static variants.
- Weather layers are metaphorical: ripple, mist, bokeh, quiet grain. They never distract.
