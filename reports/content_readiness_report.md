### /blog
- Contains hard-banned phrase: "tailored".
> Everything here is general information. It can be a useful starting point, but it can’t replace advice tailored to you after an examination. If something you read here raises questions about your own teeth or gums, we’re happy to talk it through at an appointment.

### /dental-checkups-oral-cancer-screening
- Uses "calm" more than once (limit is once per page).

### /patient-portal
- Contains hard-banned phrase: "designed to".
> Our patient portal is designed to keep key information in one secure place — helping you stay organised before, during and after appointments. Depending on what you’re using it for, the portal may include appointment details, forms, messages, treatment plans, and helpful aftercare information. If you’re not sure whether the portal is relevant for your situation, our team can guide you. We also keep communication simple: if you prefer to speak to us directly, you can always call the practice. The portal is an optional support tool, built around clarity and convenience rather than complexity.

The benefit of the home approach is precision: the trays are tailored to your teeth, the gel is used in measured doses, and you can pace treatment to manage sensitivity. We’ll check your teeth and gums first, because untreated decay, gum disease or exposed roots can make whitening uncomfortable and unpredictable. If you have existing restorations on the front teeth, we’ll explain how whitening affects the natural tooth but not the restorations, and how we can plan any replacements afterwards if needed for a balanced look.
