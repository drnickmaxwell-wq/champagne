# Champagne Sound Design Canon

Champagne sound = ASMR luxury: glass, water, air, enamel.  
Volume is always low, durations short, and nothing ever feels “gamey”.

## 1. Sound Material Families

### 1.1 Glass Tone

- Cold, bright but soft.
- High-frequency whisper, not ringing.
- Used for taps, navigation selection, card activation.

### 1.2 Water Tone

- Gentle droplets and soft ripples.
- Used for confirmations, deeper navigation, modal transitions.

### 1.3 Enamel Tone

- Subtle ceramic “ting”.
- Used for precision tools, 3D model interactions, technical UI.

### 1.4 Air Tone

- Soft exhale or micro-whoosh.
- Used for transitions, dismissals, back navigation.

## 2. Behaviour Laws

1. Volume ≤ 12% of system volume by default.
2. Individual sounds < 200ms except rare ceremonial cues (≤ 450ms).
3. At most one sound per interaction.
4. Sounds inherit emotional lighting:
   - Warm scenes → more water/air emphasis
   - Cool scenes → more glass/enamel bias

## 3. Canon Examples

- Tap sound → soft glass “ting”.
- Confirm sound → water droplet.
- Dismiss/back → air whoosh.
- Precision lock-in → enamel tick.
- Ceremonial moment → warm gold shimmer sound (short, diffuse).
