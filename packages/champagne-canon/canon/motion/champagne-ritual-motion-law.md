# Champagne Ritual Motion Law

Champagne uses **rituals**, not generic animations.  
Each ritual is a symbolic movement that acknowledges emotionally important events.

Rituals are subtle, respectful, and almost invisible – but felt.

## 2. Rules of Ritual Motion

1. Rituals must never overlap – only one at a time.
2. Rituals may temporarily add a `layer.ritual` above content, removed automatically within 2400ms.
3. Rituals must honour PRM:
   - When PRM is on, rituals fall back to **opacity-only** soft fades (≤ 240ms).
4. Rituals must never obstruct legibility or alter layout structure.
