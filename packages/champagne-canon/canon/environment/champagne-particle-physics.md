# Champagne Particle Physics Canon

Particles in Champagne represent micro-physical beauty:
- glass dust  
- water motes  
- enamel scatter  
- gradient smoke  

All are calm, micro-scale, and cinematic.

## 1. Particle Types

### 1.1 Glass Dust
- Small soft drift
- Horizontal or diagonal
- Never sparkly
Use for: treatment explainers, portal hero.

---

### 1.2 Water Motes
- Spherical micro-bubbles
- Rise slowly (≤0.3px/s)
- Opacity <1%
Use for: deep ink experiences, immersive hero moments.

---

### 1.3 Enamel Scatter
- Directional micro-burst
- Extremely short lifespan (~120ms)
Use for: 3D viewer interactions, tooth rotation cues.

---

### 1.4 Gradient Smoke
- Soft colour clouds drifting at <0.5px/sec
- Follows gradient direction (135°)
Use for: long-scroll cosmetic storytelling.

---

## 2. Physics Laws

1. No particle may move faster than 2px/sec.
2. Density must remain <3%.
3. Particles must never overlap the content layer.
4. No flashing or strobing clusters are allowed.
5. Gold particles are forbidden (ritual-only element).

## 3. Layer Mapping

Particles sit strictly in:
- `layer.particleField`
- below any text or CTAs
- above weather, below glass overlays

Stack Guard will fail builds if placement is violated.
