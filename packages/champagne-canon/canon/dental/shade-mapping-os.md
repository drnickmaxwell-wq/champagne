# Champagne Shade Mapping OS

A cinematic, enamel-aware shade interpretation system designed to present shade information emotionally safely and clinically accurately.

---

## 1. Shade Model Dimensions

- Base Chroma (A/B/C/D analog)
- Value (brightness)
- Translucency Gradient (incisal → cervical)
- Warmth Bias (amber vs grey)

This creates a *shade volume*, not a single code.

## 2. Visualisation Laws

1. Shade must ALWAYS be shown on 3D enamel, never flat rectangles.
2. Side-by-side comparisons use real geometry.
3. Differences appear as colour drift, not flashes.
4. Patient views use Beauty HDR; clinical views use Studio/Clinical HDR.
5. No “bad tooth” framing – only “current vs designed”.

## 3. Scene Types

### 3.1 Patient-Calm View
- Lighting: Beauty HDR (warm, cinematic)
- FX: very minimal
- Language: “warmer / cooler / brighter / softer”

### 3.2 Clinical Detail View
- Lighting: Studio HDR (cool, precise)
- Allows translucency maps, enamel vs ceramic comparison.
