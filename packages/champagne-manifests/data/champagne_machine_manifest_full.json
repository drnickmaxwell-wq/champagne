Planning matters: before any surgery we assess your mouth, review your medical history, and use CBCT imaging and digital scans to map bone, nerves, bite and the final tooth shape. This allows us to discuss realistic options, timing, and whether additional steps such as bone grafting or sinus lift assessment may be relevant. If implants aren\u2019t the right fit, we\u2019ll explain alternatives such as bridges or removable solutions and help you choose an approach that\u2019s stable, maintainable and comfortable long-term."

They can be an excellent option when the teeth underneath are healthy enough, and when the plan is conservative and carefully staged. We start by understanding what you\u2019d like to change, then assess enamel, bite, gum health and wear patterns so the result is stable and maintainable. In many cases, we can explore minimal-prep or additive approaches, or consider alternatives such as whitening, bonding, or aligners first. If veneers are suitable, we\u2019ll talk through preview options, longevity factors and how to protect the finished work."

For some patients, whitening or aligner straightening first can improve the final result and reduce the amount of composite needed. If bonding is a good fit, we\u2019ll explain what it can achieve, how it\u2019s maintained, and what to expect with polishing and repairs."

For others, it may involve whitening, bonding, veneers or restorative work to address wear, damage or long-standing problems.\n\nThe most important part is the assessment and planning stage. We take time to understand what\u2019s bothering you, examine your teeth and bite carefully, and look at what is realistically achievable. In many cases, treatment is staged over time rather than rushed.\n\nNot everyone needs a full smile makeover. Sometimes smaller, simpler steps can make a meaningful difference.
