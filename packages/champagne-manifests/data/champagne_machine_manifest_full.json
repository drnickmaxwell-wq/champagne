Appointments are structured so you understand what we’ve found, what it means, and what options are sensible for your goals and circumstances. If you’re anxious, short on time, or simply want things explained properly, we’ll take a measured approach and agree the next step together."

Planning matters: before any surgery we assess your mouth, review your medical history, and use CBCT imaging and digital scans to map bone, nerves, bite and the final tooth shape. This allows us to discuss realistic options, timing, and whether additional steps such as bone grafting or sinus lift assessment may be relevant. If implants aren’t the right fit, we’ll explain alternatives such as bridges or removable solutions and help you choose an approach that’s stable, maintainable and comfortable long-term."

          "copy": "Veneers are thin restorations placed on the front surface of teeth to refine shape, colour and alignment. They can be an excellent option when the teeth underneath are healthy enough, and when the plan is conservative and carefully staged. We start by understanding what you’d like to change, then assess enamel, bite, gum health and wear patterns so the result is stable and maintainable. In many cases, we can explore minimal-prep or additive approaches, or consider alternatives such as whitening, bonding, or aligners first. If veneers are suitable, we’ll talk through preview options, longevity factors and how to protect the finished work."

Aligners can help with crowding, spacing and some bite corrections, but not every case is suitable — and retention is essential to keep results stable. We’ll also discuss where aligners fit alongside whitening, bonding or restorative work, especially if you’re planning a broader smile refresh. If aligners are recommended, you’ll receive a clear timeline, check-in plan and aftercare guidance."

This breadth allows patients to receive both routine and advanced care within the same practice, without losing the familiarity and trust that come from seeing a consistent team.\n\nStability is a defining feature of the practice. We have served the local community for over 40 years, with long-standing members of staff and many patients who have attended since childhood and continue to return with their own families. This continuity allows treatment decisions to be made with a deeper understanding of patient history, preferences and long-term goals.\n\nPatients who feel anxious about dental treatment are supported with time, clear explanations and a respectful, unhurried approach.

If a particular dentist is unavailable, handover is managed within the practice so that patients are supported by colleagues who understand their history, current position and long-term plan.\n\nThe team places particular emphasis on supporting nervous and anxious patients. Time is taken to explain findings and options clearly, without pressure, and treatment is adapted to suit individual comfort levels. Patients are encouraged to move at a pace that feels right for them, with the understanding that informed decisions often take time.\n\nContinuity also means knowing when not to proceed. Treatment is not rushed, and monitoring or phased approaches are often recommended where problems are stable or where immediate intervention would add unnecessary risk. Where focused expertise is clearly in a patient’s high standards interest, referrals are made to trusted specialists.\n\nPatients trust this team because care is delivered with honesty, respect and long-term responsibility. Recommendations are grounded in evidence and experience, with a focus on what is predictable, maintainable and appropriate — not simply what can be done.",

Treatment is adapted to individual comfort levels, and patients are kept fully informed and in control throughout their care.\n\nHer dual training as a dentist and dental technician supports a precise, considered approach to both aesthetic and functional treatment.

For some patients, whitening or aligner straightening first can improve the final result and reduce the amount of composite needed. If bonding is a good fit, we’ll explain what it can achieve, how it’s maintained, and what to expect with polishing and repairs."

The goal is to restore function and protect the remaining tooth structure, while keeping the bite comfortable and the margins clean and maintainable. We plan crowns using a full assessment and digital scans so we can check contact points, bite forces and appearance before anything is finalised. Where appropriate, we’ll discuss onlays or adhesive options that preserve more natural tooth. If a crown is recommended, we’ll explain materials, preparation, and how to look after it."
