        {
          "question": "How long does a dental bridge last?",
          "answer": "Longevity depends on the strength of the supporting teeth, gum health, and your cleaning routine. With good hygiene and routine reviews, bridges can serve reliably for many years; we outline the maintenance needed at each review."
        },
        {
          "question": "When might an implant or denture be a better option?",
          "answer": "If the neighbouring teeth are unrestored, lack support, or the gap is wide, a dental implant or implant-retained denture can avoid overloading them. We also compare removable dentures when flexibility or a non-preparation option is preferred."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are cantilever or resin-bonded bridges safe?",
          "answer": "They can be appropriate in carefully selected cases with light bite forces and strong enamel. Cantilevers are limited to short spans, and resin-bonded bridges need controlled moisture and monitoring. We will advise if a conventional bridge, crown support, or implant offers better stability."
        },
        {
          "question": "Who is not suitable for a bridge?",
          "answer": "Active gum disease, significant tooth mobility, short clinical crowns, or uncontrolled grinding reduce predictability. In these situations we stabilise the gums first or plan alternatives such as dental implants or implant-retained dentures before proceeding."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do the supporting teeth need crowns?",
          "answer": "Conventional bridges often use crowned or onlay-style retainers to share the load. Where appropriate we keep preparation minimal, but if the abutment tooth already needs protection, a well-fitting crown can improve the bridge’s long-term stability."
