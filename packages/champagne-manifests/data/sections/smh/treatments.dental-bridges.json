      "body": "A dental bridge replaces one or more missing teeth by supporting a fixed tooth (or teeth) between neighbouring teeth or implants. Suitability depends on the health of the supporting teeth, gum condition, bite forces and the size and position of the gap. We assess the area carefully, because a bridge should feel stable, cleanable and comfortable in the long term. In some cases, an implant or a removable option may be more appropriate, particularly if the neighbouring teeth are intact. If a bridge is a good fit, we’ll explain material options, preparation, expected maintenance, and how to keep the margins healthy with daily cleaning.",
