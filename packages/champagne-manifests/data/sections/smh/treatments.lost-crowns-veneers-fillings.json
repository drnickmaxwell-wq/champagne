      "title": "Why it’s worth seeing us promptly",
      "body": "When a restoration comes out, the underlying tooth is often more vulnerable than it looks.\n\nExposed dentine can be very sensitive, and the tooth can fracture more easily — especially if it’s already heavily filled. If there is decay or a crack underneath, delaying can reduce the options.\n\nSeeing you early helps us protect the tooth, manage discomfort, and plan a repair that lasts."

          "answer": "Sometimes, yes. If the crown is intact and the tooth underneath is healthy and stable, re-cementing can be a good option. If decay, a crack, or fit issues are present, replacing the crown may be safer long-term."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will you reuse my crown or veneer?",
          "answer": "In most cases, swallowed dental restorations pass through without causing harm. If you have breathing symptoms, chest pain, or you think it may have been inhaled, seek urgent medical advice. Either way, contact us so we can protect the tooth and plan the next step."

          "question": "Is it urgent if I have no pain?",
          "answer": "Temporary dental cements can sometimes help short-term, but they can also trap bacteria if used incorrectly. The safest approach is to keep the area clean, avoid chewing on that side, and call us. If you do use a temporary product, treat it as a short stop-gap, not a fix."
