Options can include clear aligners or fixed braces, depending on the complexity of movement needed and the stability of the bite. We begin with diagnosis: assessing gum health, tooth wear, jaw symptoms and how your teeth meet, then using digital scans (and X-rays where appropriate) to plan movement and discuss what’s realistic. Orthodontics can be valuable on its own or as preparation for restorative work such as bonding, crowns or veneers. We’ll explain timelines, retention, and the checks needed to keep treatment on track safely.",
