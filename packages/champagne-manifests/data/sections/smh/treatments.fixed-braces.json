      "body": "Fixed braces move teeth using brackets and wires, offering a highly controlled way to correct alignment and bite problems. They can be a good choice where movements are more complex, where precise finishing is important, or where aligners are less suitable. We’ll assess gum health, enamel condition and bite forces before starting, then plan the sequence of movement and discuss expected timelines. During treatment, regular reviews allow adjustments to keep progress steady and safe. Retention is essential after braces, so we’ll explain retainers and long-term maintenance. If your goals include cosmetic refinements afterwards, we’ll help sequence whitening or bonding sensibly.",
