      "body": "A chip or crack isn’t always an emergency, but it can change quickly.\n\nSmall fractures can spread, and exposed dentine can become very sensitive. In some cases, cracks allow bacteria to reach the nerve, leading to infection.\n\nSeeing you early gives us more conservative options — and helps prevent the problem turning into a bigger repair."

      "label": "What we can do",
      "title": "Possible treatments",
      "body": "Treatment depends on where the crack is, how deep it goes, and how much tooth is missing.\n\nOptions may include smoothing a sharp edge, a bonded repair (composite), replacing or reshaping an old filling, or protecting the tooth with an onlay or crown.\n\nIf the nerve is involved, root canal treatment may be needed — but we only recommend that when it’s clearly indicated.",

        {
          "question": "Will I need a crown straight away?",
