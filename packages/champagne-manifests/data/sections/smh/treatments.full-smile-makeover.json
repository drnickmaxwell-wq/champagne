      "body": "A full smile makeover is a way of looking at your teeth together, rather than treating individual problems in isolation. People often come to us with a mix of concerns — how their teeth look, how they function, or how they’ve changed over time.\n\nRather than jumping straight to treatment, we start by understanding what matters to you and what’s realistically achievable. In many cases, there is more than one way forward. Some options are simpler and more conservative, while others are more involved and take longer.\n\nOur role is to help you understand those options clearly, including their limits, so you can decide what feels right for you.\n\n---",

      "body": "Planning is the most important part of any smile makeover. This usually involves careful examination, photographs, scans, and discussion, rather than making quick decisions.\n\nThis stage helps us see how your teeth fit together, where changes may be helpful, and where they may not be appropriate. It also allows time to talk through expectations and agree a plan that makes sense before any treatment starts.\n\n---",

The aim is to move forward in a controlled way, rather than trying to do everything at once.\n\nSome stages focus on creating space or alignment, others on improving appearance or repairing wear. We plan these steps carefully so that earlier treatment supports what comes later.\n\n---",
