We start with assessment and X-rays to understand root shape, bone support and proximity to nearby structures. Options are explained clearly, including whether a simple extraction is appropriate or whether a surgical approach is required. Comfort is prioritised using effective local anaesthetic, and we’ll talk through what to expect during healing, pain control and how to reduce the risk of complications such as dry socket. Where relevant, we also discuss replacement options and timing after an extraction.",
