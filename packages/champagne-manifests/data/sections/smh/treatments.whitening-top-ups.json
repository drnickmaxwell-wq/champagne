The need for top-ups varies — it depends on your starting shade, diet, staining habits, and how long you’d like the result to stay at a particular level. We’ll explain sensible intervals and how to avoid overuse, because more gel isn’t necessarily better and can increase sensitivity. If you already have custom trays, we can advise on appropriate gels and protocols; if not, we’ll assess your teeth and gums first. We’ll also discuss how top-ups interact with existing crowns or composite edges to keep your smile looking even.",
