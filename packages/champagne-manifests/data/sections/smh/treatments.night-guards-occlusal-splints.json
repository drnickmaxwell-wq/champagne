      "body": "Night guards and occlusal splints are custom appliances designed to protect teeth and help manage bite-related strain. They are often used for grinding/clenching, tooth wear, fracture risk or jaw discomfort. We assess how your teeth meet, where forces concentrate and whether your symptoms suggest muscle overload or joint irritation. The appliance is then designed to fit comfortably and distribute forces more evenly. Splints don’t “cure” bruxism, but they can reduce damage and improve comfort while we monitor the situation. We’ll also explain care, expected adaptation time and when adjustments are needed.",

          "question": "Are there alternatives if I do not want a splint?",
          "answer": "Management may include exercises, habit coaching, or muscle therapies, but a splint is often the safest way to protect teeth and dental work from night-time forces. We will outline all options."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long will my splint last?",
          "answer": "Durability depends on grinding forces, material choice, and care. We advise expected replacement intervals and check fit at reviews so we can refresh before wear reduces protection."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I look after the splint?",
          "answer": "Rinse and brush it gently after use, store it in a ventilated case, and avoid heat. Bring it to appointments so we can clean and adjust it, especially if your bite changes."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the risks or limitations?",
          "answer": "Splints can feel tight or cause tenderness if contacts are uneven; adjustments resolve this. Wear or cracks may occur with heavy grinding, so periodic review is important."
        },
        {
          "question": "How are night guards priced?",
          "answer": "Fees reflect the material, lab or in-house production, and the complexity of your bite. We provide a written estimate and discuss phased care if repairs or replacements are anticipated."

        {
          "question": "Will it affect speech or breathing?",
