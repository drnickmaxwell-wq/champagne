          "question": "How many implants are needed?",

        {
          "question": "Are they removable?",
          "answer": "Many implant-retained dentures are designed to be removed for daily cleaning while staying secure during eating and speaking. Suitability depends on your specific plan."

        {
          "question": "Will they feel bulky?",

        {
          "question": "Does the procedure hurt?",
          "answer": "Implant placement is carried out with local anaesthetic and a calm approach. Some pressure and post-treatment soreness are expected, with clear guidance to keep you comfortable."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long do they last?",
          "answer": "Implants are intended for long-term use, but longevity depends on healing, home care, and attending regular reviews to monitor implant health and denture fit."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does treatment cost?",

        {
          "question": "Can I upgrade later to a fixed bridge?",
