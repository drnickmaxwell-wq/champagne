We plan your treatment carefully, monitor progress closely, and keep the focus on long-term stability — not rushed cosmetic changes.\n\nWe start with a clinical assessment and a digital scan. From there, we map what can be moved safely, what should be left alone, and what would benefit from preparation (for example, bite adjustment or selective shaping).\n\nIf aligners are suitable, you’ll wear a series of custom trays that guide small, controlled movements over time. You’ll know what the process involves, what the limitations are, and what retention will look like before we begin.",

Small steps add up to meaningful change.\n\nSome cases need small attachments (to help grip and guide movement) or minor reshaping between teeth. We’ll only recommend what’s clinically justified and explain why.\n\nAligners can be excellent for mild–moderate crowding and spacing, and in some cases more complex changes — but not every bite is a safe aligner case.

          "question": "Will aligners fix my bite as well as straighten my teeth?",
          "answer": "Sometimes, yes — within limits. Cosmetic alignment and bite correction overlap, but they’re not the same thing. We’ll check whether your bite goals are achievable with aligners or whether another approach would be more predictable."

          "question": "Will I need attachments?",

          "question": "What happens when I finish?",

          "question": "Can aligners be combined with whitening or bonding?",
          "answer": "Often, yes — but sequencing matters. We usually align first, stabilise the bite, then consider whitening and/or edge bonding if appropriate. We’ll advise based on your enamel, bite and goals."

          "question": "What if my teeth stop tracking?",
