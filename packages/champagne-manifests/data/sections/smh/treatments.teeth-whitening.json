      "body": "Teeth whitening lightens the natural colour of teeth using peroxide-based gels, most commonly with custom trays worn at home and, in selected cases, an in-practice approach. Whitening works best when teeth and gums are healthy, so we begin with an assessment to check for decay, leaking fillings, gum inflammation, and causes of sensitivity. We explain what shade change is realistic for your starting colour and how results can be maintained with appropriate top-ups. Whitening does not change the colour of crowns, veneers, or fillings, so we plan around existing dental work and discuss options if a more even overall result is needed.",
