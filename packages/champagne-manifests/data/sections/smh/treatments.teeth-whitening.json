It does not change the structure of the teeth, but works by breaking down stains that have built up over time.\n\nWhitening can be effective, but results vary between individuals. The starting shade of your teeth, the type of staining present, and your general oral health all influence how much lightening is possible.\n\nBefore considering whitening, it’s important to understand what it can and cannot achieve. A proper assessment helps ensure the treatment is suitable and expectations are realistic.",
