      "title": "Replacing a single missing tooth with an implant",
      "body": "A single tooth dental implant may be considered when one tooth is missing and the surrounding teeth are otherwise healthy. It is one of several options for replacing a single tooth and is not always the most appropriate solution.\n\nTreatment decisions should be based on clinical assessment, long-term risk, and maintenance — not on replacing a tooth simply because it can be done.\n\nHow a single tooth implant works\n\nA single tooth implant involves placing a titanium implant into the jawbone to support a custom-made crown. The implant acts as the foundation, while the crown replaces the visible part of the tooth.\n\nThis treatment is planned as part of a wider restorative approach and usually involves assessment, placement, healing, and restoration over time.\n\nWhen a single tooth implant may be suitable\n\nA single tooth implant may be considered if:\n- You are missing one tooth\n- The neighbouring teeth are healthy and do not require treatment\n- There is adequate bone, or bone grafting is possible\n- Gum health is stable\n- You are able to maintain good oral hygiene\n\nAlternatives to a single tooth implant\n\nDepending on your circumstances, alternatives may include:\n- A fixed dental bridge\n- A removable partial denture\n- Leaving the space untreated if appropriate\n\nPlanning and long-term considerations\n\nSingle tooth implants require ongoing care and professional maintenance. They are not maintenance-free and are not guaranteed.\n\nRelationship to wider implant treatment\n\nSingle tooth implants are one form of implant treatment. For a broader explanation of implant care, planning, risks, and alternatives, see the Dental Implants page.",
