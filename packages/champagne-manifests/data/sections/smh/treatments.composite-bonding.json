      "title": "Conservative improvements, well planned",
      "body": "Composite bonding is a conservative cosmetic treatment that improves the appearance of teeth by adding tooth-coloured resin in controlled layers.\n\nIt is commonly used to refine shape, close small gaps, or repair minor chips. Because it usually involves little or no removal of natural tooth structure, it is a lower-intervention option than treatments that require more preparation.\n\nSuitability depends on the condition of your teeth, your bite, and what you want to achieve. We assess these carefully before recommending treatment."
