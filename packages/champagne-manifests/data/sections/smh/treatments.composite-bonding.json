      "title": "Conservative improvements, well planned",
      "body": "Composite bonding is a conservative cosmetic treatment used to improve the appearance of teeth by carefully adding tooth-coloured resin to the surface.\n\nIt is commonly used to adjust shape, close small gaps, or repair minor chips. Because it involves minimal or no removal of natural tooth structure, it is often considered a lower-intervention option compared with other cosmetic treatments.\n\nWhether composite bonding is appropriate depends on your teeth, bite, and expectations, which we assess before recommending treatment."

        "Composite bonding uses a resin material that is shaped directly onto the tooth and then hardened using a curing light.",
