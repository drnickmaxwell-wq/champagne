      "body": "Gum care focuses on reducing inflammation and protecting the bone and tissues that support your teeth. Gum disease often progresses quietly, with bleeding, bad breath or tenderness as early signs. We assess gum pocket depths, bleeding points and contributing factors such as smoking, medical conditions and bite stress, then recommend care based on your risk level. Treatment may include targeted cleaning below the gum line and guidance on brushing and interdental cleaning that’s realistic to maintain at home. The aim is to stabilise the condition, keep gums comfortable and reduce the chance of long-term problems such as mobility or tooth loss.",
