        },
        {
          "question": "Do veneers ruin teeth?",
          "answer": "We only suggest veneers when the benefit outweighs the enamel we may need to remove. Minimal-prep options are used when safe, and we explain all implications before you decide."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long do veneers last?",

        {
          "question": "Can I whiten veneers?",

        },
        {
          "question": "Do they hurt?",

        {
          "question": "What if one chips?",
          "answer": "Contact us promptly. Minor chips may be polished or repaired; larger issues might need a replacement or a revised bite assessment."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there alternatives?",
          "answer": "Yes. Composite bonding, professional whitening, orthodontics, or crowns may be more suitable depending on your goals. We discuss options before recommending veneers."
