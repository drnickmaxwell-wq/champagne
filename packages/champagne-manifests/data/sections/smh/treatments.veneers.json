      "body": "Veneers are thin restorations placed on the front surface of teeth to refine shape, colour and alignment. They can be an excellent option when the teeth underneath are healthy enough, and when the plan is conservative and carefully staged. We start by understanding what you’d like to change, then assess enamel, bite, gum health and wear patterns so the result is stable and maintainable. In many cases, we can explore minimal-prep or additive approaches, or consider alternatives such as whitening, bonding, or aligners first. If veneers are suitable, we’ll talk through preview options, longevity factors and how to protect the finished work.",
