        {
          "question": "Are there alternatives to a crown?",
          "answer": "Depending on remaining tooth structure, options may include an onlay, bonded repair, or monitoring. We map crack risk and bite forces to advise when full coverage is the safer route."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long will my crown last?",
          "answer": "Durability depends on bite forces, hygiene, and material. We choose ceramics or metal-ceramic options to suit your case and schedule reviews to check margins and contacts over time."
        },
        {
          "question": "What maintenance does a crown need?",
          "answer": "Clean carefully around the margins and attend regular hygiene appointments. Bite checks help us refine contacts and spot early signs of wear or gum inflammation."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the risks or limitations?",
          "answer": "Crowns can chip, loosen, or develop decay at the margins if hygiene or bite balance is poor. We plan coverage height and consider splints if grinding is present to reduce these risks."
        },
        {
          "question": "How are crowns priced?",

          "question": "Will the crown match my other teeth?",
