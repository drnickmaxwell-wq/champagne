          "question": "How white can teeth go?",

        {
          "question": "Does whitening affect veneers or crowns?",

          "question": "How long does whitening last?",

        {
          "question": "Is whitening part of a smile makeover?",
          "answer": "Often yes. Whitening is the “B” in our Align, Bleach, Composite approach so colour is set before aligning teeth or adding bonding (/treatments/composite-bonding). It also supports Digital Smile Design (/treatments/digital-smile-design) and veneer planning (/treatments/veneers)."
