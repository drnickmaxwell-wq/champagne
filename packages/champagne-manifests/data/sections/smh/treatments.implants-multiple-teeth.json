      "body": "Replacing several missing teeth with implants can improve stability, function and comfort, but the plan depends on the pattern of missing teeth, the bite, and how much bone support is available. We assess the area clinically and with CBCT imaging, then use digital planning to decide the number and position of implants needed to support a bridge or individual crowns. We’ll discuss options for staged treatment, temporary teeth during healing, and how maintenance works long-term. Where implants aren’t the best fit — due to anatomy, medical considerations, or preference — we’ll explain alternatives such as conventional bridges or removable solutions and what the trade-offs are.",
