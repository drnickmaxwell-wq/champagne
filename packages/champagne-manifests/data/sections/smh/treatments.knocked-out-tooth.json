In some situations, we discuss replacement options if replantation isn’t possible.\n\nWe’ll explain the likely risks, the aftercare required, and what long-term maintenance might involve.",

          "question": "What if the tooth looks damaged?",
          "answer": "If the tooth is broken, cracked, or visibly contaminated, replantation may be less suitable — but it depends on the situation. Keep the tooth safe and moist, avoid touching the root, and contact us so we can assess what’s realistic."

          "question": "Do I need a tetanus check?",
