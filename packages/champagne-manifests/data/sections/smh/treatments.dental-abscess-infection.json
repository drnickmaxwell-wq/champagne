      "body": "A dental abscess is an infection that can build pressure and cause significant pain, swelling, or a bad taste.\n\nSometimes symptoms come and go, but the underlying infection usually needs proper assessment and treatment. Leaving it can allow the infection to spread and can make the tooth harder to save.\n\nIf you have facial swelling, difficulty swallowing, fever, or you feel generally unwell, seek urgent advice and contact us as soon as possible.",

      "body": "Infections can start quietly — sometimes as a dull ache, sometimes as sensitivity, and sometimes with no pain until swelling appears.\n\nAn abscess can come from the tooth nerve, from gum disease, or from a crack or deep decay letting bacteria in.\n\nIf you’re unsure whether it’s an emergency, call us. We can advise on urgency and what to do while you’re waiting to be seen."

      "body": "Infections are not always solved by antibiotics alone. Antibiotics can be appropriate in some situations, but the source of infection usually still needs treating.\n\nThat might mean draining the infection, cleaning and sealing the tooth with root canal treatment, treating gum infection, or removing a tooth that cannot be saved.\n\nOur job is to assess the cause, explain the realistic options, and help you stabilise quickly — then plan longer-term care in a calm, sensible way."

        {
          "question": "Do I always need antibiotics?",
          "answer": "Sometimes antibiotics are necessary, especially if there is spreading swelling or you are unwell. But an abscess usually needs the source treated as well — for example drainage, root canal treatment, gum treatment, or extraction. We’ll advise what’s appropriate after assessment."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will the swelling go away on its own?",
          "answer": "Symptoms can ease if an abscess drains, but the infection often remains and can flare again. Leaving it can increase risk of spread and reduce the chance of saving the tooth. It’s safest to get it assessed."
