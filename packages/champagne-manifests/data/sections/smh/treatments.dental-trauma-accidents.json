      "body": "Dental trauma can range from chipped enamel to displaced or loosened teeth, fractures, and injuries to gums or supporting bone. What matters most is prompt assessment: we check tooth stability, nerve response, bite changes and soft tissue injury, and take X-rays to rule out hidden fractures. Treatment might include smoothing or repairing a chip, splinting a tooth, dressing an exposed nerve, or planning follow-up care if the tooth’s nerve is at risk. We’ll also advise on pain control and what to avoid while the area heals. If a tooth has been knocked out, time is critical — see that page for immediate steps."
