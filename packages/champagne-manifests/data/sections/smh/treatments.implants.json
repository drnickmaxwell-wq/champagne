          "question": "Why use CBCT and 3D planning for implants?",
          "answer": "A CBCT scan shows bone, nerves, and sinus spaces in 3D. Planning software lets us position the implant within that anatomy and the planned crown, increasing accuracy before surgery."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a 3D-printed surgical guide?",
          "answer": "It’s a custom template designed from your scan that directs implant angulation, depth, and position. We design and print guides in-house to follow the digital plan precisely."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does guided surgery heal faster?",
          "answer": "Guided placement often allows flapless or minimally invasive techniques, which can mean less swelling and fewer stitches. Healing still varies by bone quality and overall health."
        },
        {
          "question": "Am I suitable for guided implants?",
          "answer": "Suitability depends on bone volume, gum health, bite forces, and medical history. We confirm this during your implant consultation (/treatments/implant-consultation) and may advise preparatory care first."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long do guided implants last?",
          "answer": "Implants are intended for long-term use. Longevity depends on healing, home care, attending reviews, and following aftercare guidance (/treatments/implant-aftercare)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What support is there after surgery?",
          "answer": "You receive written aftercare, review appointments, and hygiene guidance. We also discuss comfort options, including sedation (/treatments/sedation-dentistry) if anxiety makes visits difficult."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will I have a temporary tooth while it heals?",
          "answer": "In many cases we provide a provisional crown or denture so you can smile and chew gently while the implant integrates."
