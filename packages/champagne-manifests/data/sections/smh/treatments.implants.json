      "title": "Dental implants — a considered approach to replacing missing teeth",
      "body": "Dental implants are one option for replacing missing teeth. They are not suitable for everyone, and they are never a shortcut. When planned carefully and maintained properly, they can offer a stable, long-term way of restoring function and confidence.\n\nAt St Mary’s House Dental Care, implant treatment is approached conservatively and individually. Decisions are based on clinical assessment, risk management, and long-term oral health — not on selling a particular technique.\n\nWhat a dental implant is — and what it isn’t\n\nA dental implant is a small titanium fixture that is placed into the jawbone to support a replacement tooth or teeth. Over time, the surrounding bone may integrate with the implant, allowing it to act as a foundation for a crown, bridge, or denture.\n\nImplants do not replace teeth on their own. They are part of a broader restorative plan that involves diagnosis, planning, healing time, and long-term maintenance. They are not instant, and they are not guaranteed.\n\nWho implant treatment may be suitable for\n\nImplant treatment may be considered if you:\n- Are missing one or more teeth\n- Have healthy gums and controlled dental disease\n- Have sufficient bone, or may be suitable for grafting\n- Are in good general health\n- Are able to maintain excellent oral hygiene\n- Understand that implants require ongoing care and review\n\nImplants are not always the best option. In some situations, alternatives such as bridges or dentures may be more appropriate. A responsible treatment plan compares these options honestly.\n\nAssessment, planning, and safety\n\nSuccessful implant treatment begins with careful assessment. This may include:\n- A full clinical examination\n- Digital scans and 3D imaging where appropriate\n- Assessment of bone levels, bite, and gum health\n- Review of medical history and risk factors\n\nPlanning is individual. Rushing this stage increases risk and compromises long-term outcomes.\n\nTreatment is usually staged — not a single appointment\n\nImplant treatment is commonly carried out in stages. Depending on your circumstances, this may include:\n- Preparatory procedures such as bone grafting\n- Placement of the implant\n- A healing period to allow integration\n- Restoration with a crown, bridge, or denture\n\nSome cases can be restored more quickly than others, but no implant treatment is truly “instant”, and outcomes vary between individuals.\n\nMaintenance, longevity, and limitations\n\nDental implants require the same — and often greater — care than natural teeth. Long-term success depends on:\n- Daily cleaning at home\n- Regular professional maintenance\n- Monitoring of gum health and bone levels\n- Avoiding habits that increase risk, such as smoking\n\nImplants can fail. Understanding this risk, and how to reduce it, is an essential part of informed consent.\n\nAlternatives to implants\n\nImplants are not the only way to replace missing teeth. Depending on your situation, alternatives may include:\n- Fixed bridges\n- Removable dentures\n- Accepting spaces where appropriate\n\nChoosing the right option involves balancing function, appearance, risk, maintenance, and long-term oral health.\n\nWhy choose St Mary’s House Dental Care\n\nImplant care here is clinician-led and carefully planned. Dr Nick Maxwell has advanced postgraduate training in restorative and aesthetic dentistry, with additional qualifications in orthodontics and facial orthopaedics. Implant treatment is supported by digital planning and guided techniques where appropriate.\n\nThe focus is on careful assessment, clear explanation, and long-term patient relationships — not speed, volume, or sales targets.",
