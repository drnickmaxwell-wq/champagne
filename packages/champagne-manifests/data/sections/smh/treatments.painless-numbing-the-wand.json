      "body": "The Wand is a computer-assisted local anaesthetic system designed to deliver anaesthetic more slowly and precisely. For some patients, this can make numbing feel more comfortable, particularly in areas where injections can be sensitive. It’s not a guarantee of “no sensation,” but it can reduce the sharp pressure that people often worry about. We still take time to apply topical anaesthetic, explain what you’ll feel and use techniques that support comfort. If you’re anxious about injections, we’ll talk through options and agree a paced approach so you remain in control throughout treatment.",
