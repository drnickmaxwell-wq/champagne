      "body": "Full-arch implant treatment is designed for people with failing teeth or missing teeth who want a stable fixed option across an entire jaw. It is not one single procedure — it’s a staged plan that may involve extractions, managing infection or gum disease, careful bite planning, and deciding whether immediate fixed teeth are appropriate. We use CBCT scans and digital planning to map bone and anatomy, then design implant positions to support a predictable final bridge. We’ll explain timelines, temporary options, maintenance requirements, and what factors affect suitability such as smoking, diabetes control, tooth grinding and bone volume. If full-arch implants aren’t right for you, we’ll outline other stable alternatives.",
