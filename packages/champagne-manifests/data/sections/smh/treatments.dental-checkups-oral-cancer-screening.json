They are an opportunity to assess your overall oral health, identify early changes, and discuss concerns before they become more complex.\n\nAs part of a routine examination, we also look for signs of oral cancer and other soft tissue conditions. These checks are visual and hands-on, and are carried out carefully at each visit.\n\nFor most people, nothing unusual is found. The value lies in consistency and familiarity — knowing what is normal for you, and noticing when something changes."
