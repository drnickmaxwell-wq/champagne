We keep appointments calm and age-appropriate, taking time to explain what we’re doing in a way that builds confidence rather than fear. Regular reviews allow us to monitor tooth development, bite changes and oral hygiene as children grow. We also give practical advice on diet, fluoride use, brushing and habits such as thumb sucking, which can affect long-term oral health. If treatment is needed, we plan it carefully with comfort and cooperation in mind, so visits remain manageable and positive.",
