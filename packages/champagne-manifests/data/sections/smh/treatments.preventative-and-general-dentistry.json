      "body": "Preventative and general dentistry is about keeping problems small — or avoiding them altogether. A thorough check-up looks at teeth, gums, bite and soft tissues, alongside any symptoms or changes you’ve noticed. These visits help us spot early decay, gum inflammation and tooth wear before they become more complex to manage. Advice is tailored to your risk factors rather than generic rules, including daily cleaning technique, fluoride use, diet and habits that affect enamel and gum health. Where simple treatment is needed, we plan it carefully to keep teeth comfortable and easy to maintain, and we agree review intervals that suit your needs.",
