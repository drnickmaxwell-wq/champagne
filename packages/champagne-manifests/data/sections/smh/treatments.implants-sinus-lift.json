      "body": "A sinus lift is a grafting procedure used in the upper back jaw when the sinus space and available bone height limit implant placement. Planning is central. We use CBCT imaging to measure bone levels, assess sinus anatomy, and decide whether a small internal lift can be carried out at the time of implant placement or whether a staged approach is safer. We’ll explain healing times, how this may affect the overall timeline, and what recovery typically involves. Not every case requires a sinus lift. Where it is not appropriate, we discuss alternatives such as shorter implants or different implant positions.",
