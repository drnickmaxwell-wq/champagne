      "body": "Mouthguards and retainers have different jobs, but both rely on precise fit to work properly. A custom mouthguard protects teeth and soft tissues during sport by distributing impact forces, while a retainer helps maintain tooth position after orthodontic treatment. We assess your bite, lifestyle needs and any existing dental work, then use impressions or digital scans to create an appliance that’s secure, comfortable and easy to clean. Regular review matters because appliances can wear, distort or stop fitting well as teeth change. The aim is predictable protection and long-term stability, not a quick off-the-shelf compromise.",
