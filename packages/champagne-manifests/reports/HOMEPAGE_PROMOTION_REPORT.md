# Homepage Promotion Report

## Sections added or reordered
- Updated `home_intro` messaging to the calm positioning copy from Manus while retaining the runtime ID.
- Kept `home_authority` in place to maintain credentials rail.
- Added Manus-sourced sections using supported runtime components:
  - `home_treatment_hub` (feature-list)
  - `home_care_pathway` (steps)
  - `home_technology_showcase` (media)
  - `home_patient_stories` (patient_stories_rail)
  - `home_finance_options` (feature-list)
  - `home_faq` (treatment_faq_block)
- Retained existing routing rails (`home_treatment_routing`, `home_special_pathways`) and refreshed `home_closing_cta` with Manus CTA set.

## Manus sections skipped
- None. All compatible Manus homepage sections were mapped to existing runtime components.

## CTA targets
- Homepage CTAs now point to `/contact`, `/treatments`, and `/patient-portal?intent=video` per CTA strategy; no `/book` links introduced.
