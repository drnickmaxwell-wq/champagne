# Phase F Authority Visibility

## Pages enhanced
- Updated 63 SMH treatment manifests to include clinician-written decision clarity guidance positioned ahead of final CTAs.

## Authority signals added
- Added “In our clinic we usually…” sequencing notes and bullets outlining suitability, alternatives, and next-step planning drawn from each treatment journey.

## CTA label adjustments
- Refined existing CTA labels to reflect journey intents, align with linked treatments, and emphasise clinician-led planning without changing destinations or counts.

## Structural integrity
- No layout, hero, CTA count, or routing structures were altered; only content and labels were updated within existing sections.
