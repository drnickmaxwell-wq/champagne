# Phase E Treatment Journey Graph

## Pages Enhanced
- Updated 77 existing SMH treatment journeys to include clinician-led entry contexts, intents, and decision links.
- Coverage spans emergency relief, preventive care, restorative pathways, orthodontic stability, implantology, and aesthetic services.

## New Relationships Added
- Defined next-best-steps and clinical alternatives for every treatment, prioritising logical flows such as implants ➜ consultations/guided surgery/aftercare and orthodontics ➜ retainers ➜ protection.
- Normalised wear and TMD pathways to surface restorative protection before aesthetic finishes and connected night guards to wear management, TMJ care, and restorative review.
- Ensured emergency journeys override elective routes with rapid escalation into endodontics or surgical relief when indicated.

## Escalation Logic
- Added intent-based escalation triggers covering uncontrolled pain, infection spread, appliance failure, and accelerated wear or relapse.
- Authority signals now highlight planning quality, material selection, and follow-up protocols appropriate to each intent.

## Validation
- All relationships reference existing treatment slugs only; no new pages were created or routed in this phase.
