# Treatments Hub Changes

- Regenerated the /treatments hub manifest to use the nine director-defined groups (emergency, general, restorative, implants, dentures, cosmetic, ortho, digital3d, facial) with featured-only listings, collapsed inventories, and View all treatments in this group links.
- Refreshed hub section copy and featured pathways to explain the grouped navigation, progressive disclosure rules, and removal of any flat directory rendering on initial load.
- Updated the reusable hub directory section manifest so titles, descriptions, featured slugs, and collapsed defaults mirror the canonical groups for menus and journeys.
- Captured the full runtime treatment inventory and deterministic slug-to-group mapping (with flags for defaults) in new reports under reports/ for auditability.
