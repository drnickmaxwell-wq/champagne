# Treatments Hub Changes

- Rebuilt the /treatments hub manifest to use ten clinician-defined groups with per-group featured slugs, collapsed inventories, and view-all links for reuse across menus and journeys.
- Updated the hub section copy to explain the grouped structure, featured pathways, and progressive disclosure behaviour.
- Added a directory section manifest stub for the grouped hub to document titles, descriptions, featured slugs, and collapsed defaults.
- Adjusted the runtime page renderer to show only featured treatments per group with clear view-all actions while keeping full inventories hidden by default.
