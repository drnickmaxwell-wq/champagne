## Before/After examples
1. **Veneers** — closing CTA keeps veneers booking while alternative “Full smile makeover” button remains for contrast.
2. **Implants – single tooth** — mid CTAs re-labelled as maintenance steps (aftercare/denture support); closing CTA adds CBCT planning as a prerequisite option.
3. **Implants – multiple teeth** — mid CTAs point to single-tooth implants and bridges; closing CTA surfaces CBCT planning as an assessment step.
4. **Implants – full arch** — focused review CTA retained across mid and closing surfaces.
5. **Sedation for implants** — sedation review CTA preserved across mid and closing buttons.
6. **Dental crowns** — alternative denture/onlay options retained while primary booking stays foregrounded.
7. **Teeth whitening** — bonding/DSD pairings kept while avoiding duplicate buttons.
8. **CBCT / 3D scanning** — framed as planning & assessment with implant pathway noted as alternative.
9. **Digital smile design** — supporting links to bonding and orthodontic steps maintained.
10. **Onlays/Inlays** — comparisons to crowns and night-guard maintenance surfaced with onlay assessment primary.
11. **Night guards** — maintenance framing for retainers and TMJ comfort retained.
12. **Periodontal** — restorative and maintenance pointers routed through gum-care pathways.
13. **Endodontics** — post-endodontic crown protection emphasised without duplicate calls.
14. **TMJ** — jaw comfort review consolidated with TMJ disorder alternative.
15. **Dental check-ups** — maintenance/protection framing for gum care and anxious patient support.
