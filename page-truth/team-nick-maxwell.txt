Profile intro
Dr Nick Maxwell
Principal Dentist · Restorative, Aesthetic & Digital Dentistry

I’m Dr Nick Maxwell, principal dentist at St Mary’s House Dental Care in Shoreham-by-Sea.
I’ve been practising dentistry since 1998 and have spent much of my career focused on the kind of dentistry that needs calm judgment: complex restorative work, aesthetic planning, bite stability, and carefully selected implant and orthodontic cases.
My aim is simple: help patients make decisions they can feel good about years from now — not just next month.

Credentials
Qualifications and training

I hold:
• BDS (King’s College London)
• MSc Restorative & Aesthetic Dentistry
• PGDip Orthodontics & Facial Orthopaedics
I’ve also completed implant surgical training and intensive implant placement training (Cairo, 2014).
Qualifications matter, but what matters most is what they change in day-to-day care: the ability to plan, select cases carefully, and avoid unnecessary intervention.

Care philosophy
How I work

Dentistry can be rushed. It can also be over-sold. I’m not interested in either.
My approach is deliberately planning-first and case-by-case:
• We start with diagnosis and stability, not “what you’d like done”
• We talk honestly about trade-offs and limitations
• I’m happy to recommend the simplest sensible option — and equally happy to advise against treatment that isn’t in your long-term interest
That’s what I mean by “sleep-at-night dentistry”.

Digital dentistry and 3D planning

Over the past several years I’ve developed a strong focus on digital dentistry — not as a gimmick, but as a way to plan more precisely and communicate more clearly.
This includes:
• digital planning workflows for restorative and implant cases
• CBCT-based assessment where appropriate
• designing and 3D-printing surgical guides for guided implant placement
• a strong emphasis on predictability and maintainability
Technology doesn’t replace clinical judgment — but used properly, it helps reduce uncertainty and improves decision-making.

Patients often come to see me when they want a calm, honest second opinion, a long-term plan rather than a quick fix, and careful aesthetic work that still respects tooth structure. If you’re looking for rushed dentistry, I won’t be the right fit. If you want careful, clinician-led planning, you probably will.
