Denture FAQs
Clarity before you proceed
How fast can 3D printed dentures be made?
Turnaround is typically faster than traditional methods because scanning and in-house printing reduce lab transit. We confirm timelines after your assessment.
Will they feel different to traditional dentures?
Digital design aims for improved comfort and retention. We plan try-ins and adjustments to ensure the fit is right for you.
Can colours be customised?
Yes. We offer gum characterisation and tooth shades guided by your clinician to keep results natural.
What if I need a reline or repair?
Stored digital files let us reprint or adjust efficiently, with the clinician checking bite and pressure points to avoid repeating issues.
Are printed dentures right for everyone?
Not often. We’ll advise if a different material or lab-made option is more appropriate based on your bite, bone support, and aesthetic goals.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after extractions and oral surgery (/treatments/extractions-and-oral-surgery) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Appropriate when you want to understand whether 3d printed dentures are appropriate and how they are made.
Often follows Extractions and oral surgery (/treatments/extractions-and-oral-surgery); Gum health management (/treatments/periodontal-gum-care).
Alternatives we balance: Senior smile care (/treatments/senior-mature-smile-care); Comfort sedation (/treatments/sedation-dentistry).
