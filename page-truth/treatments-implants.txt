Planning first, surgery second
Introduction
Dental implants replace missing teeth using a small titanium post that supports a crown, bridge, or implant-retained denture. Planning matters: before any surgery we assess your mouth, review your medical history, and use CBCT imaging and digital scans to map bone, nerves, bite and the final tooth shape. This allows us to discuss realistic options, timing, and whether additional steps such as bone grafting or sinus lift assessment may be relevant. If implants aren’t the right fit, we’ll explain alternatives such as bridges or removable solutions and help you choose an approach that’s stable, maintainable and comfortable long-term.

Dental implants in Shoreham-by-Sea
Missing teeth can change how you eat, speak and smile — and it’s not always obvious what the “right” solution is. At St Mary’s House Dental Care, implant care is clinician-led and planning-heavy: we focus on getting the foundations right so you can make a confident decision.

We’ll talk you through options (implants, bridges, dentures — or sometimes “do nothing yet”), explain the trade-offs, and recommend what’s sensible for your mouth, your health, and your long-term maintenance.

Planning-first implants
Why planning matters with implants
Dental implants can be a suitable option for many people — but they are not a “one size fits all” treatment. Outcomes depend on bone levels, gum health, bite forces, space, and the position of neighbouring teeth.

Our approach is to plan the tooth first and the implant second. Where appropriate, we use 3D imaging and digital planning to choose implant position and angulation that supports a cleanable, well-supported final crown.

Implant basics
What is a dental implant?
A dental implant is a small post placed into the jawbone to act as a replacement tooth root. Once healed, it supports a restoration — commonly a crown for a single tooth, or a bridge or denture solution for multiple teeth.

Implant treatment is usually staged and depends on healing. We’ll explain what’s involved and what alternatives might suit you better.

Timelines vary. Healing time, bone quality, and your medical history guide whether we stage treatment or move more quickly.

Digital planning
Digital and 3D dentistry for implant care
Where appropriate, we use digital scans and 3D planning to assess space, bone and bite, and to design implant placement with the final tooth in mind. We also design and 3D print surgical guides to help position implants accurately according to the plan.

Digital tools don’t replace clinical judgement — but used well, they can reduce uncertainty and improve communication.

Implant FAQs
Common questions about implants
Are dental implants right for everyone?
Not always. Suitability depends on gum health, bone levels, bite forces, medical history and maintenance. We confirm this after assessment.
Does implant treatment hurt?
Implant placement is usually done with local anaesthetic. Most people describe post-treatment soreness rather than “pain”. We’ll explain what to expect and how we manage comfort.
How long does treatment take?
Timings vary. Some cases need staged healing or additional procedures. We’ll give you a realistic timeline once we’ve assessed you.
How long do implants last?
Many implants function well for a long time, but outcomes depend on factors like cleaning, gum health, smoking, bite forces and general health. We’ll discuss risks and maintenance honestly.
What if I don’t have enough bone?
Reduced bone doesn’t automatically rule implants out. In some cases, bone grafting may be considered. We’ll explain whether it’s appropriate and the trade-offs.
What are the alternatives to implants?
Depending on your mouth, options may include bridges, dentures, or sometimes doing nothing for a period. We’ll compare pros and cons so you can choose confidently.
How much do implants cost?
Costs depend on complexity and the type of restoration. After assessment, we’ll provide clear options and fees so you can decide without pressure.

Decision clarity
A clear way to decide
Implants can be a suitable solution — but the right choice depends on your priorities: fixed versus removable options, speed versus staged healing, and what can be maintained long-term.

At your assessment we’ll answer three practical questions:
Are implants sensible and safe in your mouth?
What are the realistic options (and alternatives)?
What would we recommend if you were family?
No pressure, no hype — just a clear plan you can understand.
