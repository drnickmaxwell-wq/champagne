Emergency dental appointments
If you’re in pain, have swelling, or you’ve damaged a tooth, an emergency appointment is about stabilising the situation.

That usually means diagnosis, getting you comfortable, reducing risk, and agreeing the next sensible step. Sometimes we can fix the problem on the day. Sometimes the safest care is staged.

We’ll explain what we can see, what’s realistic, and what you can do next — without pressure.
Work out what’s happening and how urgent it is
Relieve pain and stabilise the tooth or gum
Reduce risk of infection or worsening symptoms
Plan the next step clearly and realistically

Dental problems rarely happen at a convenient time.

If you’re not sure whether you need to be seen urgently, contact us. We’ll ask a few focused questions and advise timing.

If you have rapid facial swelling, fever, difficulty swallowing, or breathing problems, seek urgent medical help immediately (A&E / 999) and then let us know as soon as you can.

Why assessment matters
Emergency care works best when we diagnose the cause properly, not just the symptom.

Pain can come from decay, infection, cracks, gum problems, or failed restorations — and the right solution depends on what we find.

Seeing you early often gives more conservative options, better comfort, and fewer repeat flare-ups.

What we can do
What an emergency appointment can involve
An emergency visit usually includes an examination and, where appropriate, X-rays to understand what’s happening under the surface.

We’ll explain the likely cause, discuss options and costs, and agree the safest next step. That might be a temporary stabilisation, a simple repair, or a plan for staged treatment.

Our aim is clarity, comfort, and a sensible route forward.

Emergency appointment FAQs
Can you always fix the problem on the day?
Not always — it depends on the cause and what’s safest for the tooth. Sometimes we can provide a definitive repair. Other times the priority is stabilisation and pain control, followed by a planned appointment for the longer-term fix. We’ll explain this clearly at the visit.
What if I am nervous about urgent treatment?
Tell us. We’ll take a calm, step-by-step approach: clear explanation, breaks if you need them, and a plan that feels manageable. Emergency dentistry isn’t about rushing you — it’s about getting you safe and comfortable.
Do I need a referral for an emergency visit?
No. You can contact the practice directly. If we think you need another service urgently (for example, medical assessment after trauma or signs of a serious spreading infection), we’ll tell you clearly and help you choose the safest next step.
