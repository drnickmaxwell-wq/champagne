Dermal filler consultation
Dermal fillers can be used to restore balance, support facial structure, and soften changes that develop over time.

We’ll assess facial proportions, skin quality, and movement, explain what’s realistic, and only recommend treatment where it’s appropriate, subtle, and safe.

Consultation & planning
Safety-first planning for balanced restoration
We review your goals, medical history, and facial structure before suggesting filler. If appropriate, we map areas such as cheeks, lips, chin, or tear troughs and agree conservative volumes. Alternatives like skin boosters (/treatments/skin-boosters) or polynucleotides (/treatments/polynucleotides) are offered when better suited.
Baseline photos and proportion checks to avoid overfilling
Discussion of product choice, anticipated longevity, and maintenance
Consent covering risks including swelling, bruising, and vascular compromise
Clear plan for staged treatment rather than large single sessions

Assess, treat, review
Longevity varies by product and area. We avoid excessive volume in one sitting to protect tissue health.

Products & technique
Layered placement with product matched to purpose
Fillers are selected for cohesiveness, lift, and flexibility based on treatment area. We document depth, plane, and volume per point, using cannulas for glide when helpful and needles for precision where appropriate.

Dermal filler FAQs
Common questions
How long do fillers last?
Most hyaluronic acid fillers integrate over days and may last 6–18 months depending on area, product, and lifestyle.
Can fillers be dissolved?
Yes. If clinically indicated, hyaluronidase can reverse hyaluronic acid fillers. We keep this available and explain the process before treatment.
Will it look overdone?
We favour subtle changes and staged sessions. Photography and proportion checks help us avoid overfilling.
Is there downtime?
Most patients resume light activities the same day. Swelling or bruising can last a few days; we provide aftercare and check-ins.
Can fillers be combined with other therapies?
Often yes, with careful sequencing. We may pair fillers with anti-wrinkle treatment (/treatments/anti-wrinkle-treatments) or skin boosters (/treatments/skin-boosters) when appropriate.
