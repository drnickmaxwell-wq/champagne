Smile transformations, simplified
Our smile gallery shares examples of treatments carried out at St Mary’s House Dental Care, with the aim of helping you understand what different options can look like in real life. Every smile is unique and results vary, so these cases are here to support informed conversations — not to promise a specific outcome. Where we share before-and-after images, we do so with consent and with context about the type of work involved. If you see a result you like, we can discuss whether a similar approach is clinically suitable for you, and what the planning would involve.
Overview

Cases overview
Each case includes a brief summary of the starting point, the type of treatment provided, and the kind of planning involved.

Where before-and-after images are shown, they are there to help you understand what may be possible — not to suggest you will get an identical result. Photographs also don’t show everything that matters in dentistry, such as bite, gum health, long-term maintenance, or the stability of the underlying teeth.

If you see a style of outcome you like, we can talk through whether a similar approach is clinically suitable for you and what would need to be assessed first.
