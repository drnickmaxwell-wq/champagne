UNDERSTANDING FAILURE
Why do dental implants fail?
Common factors can include infection, bone loss, bite forces, smoking, systemic health, implant position, and maintenance issues. Every case is different, so we review your records and scans before recommending any change.

Assessment tools that guide safer decisions
Diagnostics and planning lead every recommendation — technology supports careful assessment rather than rushed treatment. Replacement isn’t often immediate, and the right tools help us map the safest sequence.

Failed implant questions, answered calmly
Why did my implant fail?
Causes vary — infection, bite forces, bone quality, smoking, systemic health, positioning, and maintenance can all play a role. We review your specific history and scans before advising next steps.
Can a failed implant be replaced?
Sometimes, but the right approach depends on why it failed. Replacement may follow healing or stabilisation to protect surrounding bone and gum.
Do you have to remove a failed implant first?
If an implant is loose, painful, or infected, removal might be safer before planning any replacement. We’ll outline the options and timing.
Will I need a bone graft?
Bone support is reviewed on CBCT scans. If volume is reduced, grafting or a staged approach might be recommended to improve stability.
How long do I need to wait before replacement?
Healing time depends on the cause of failure and bone health. Replacement isn’t often immediate; we propose a timeline after assessment.
Is replacement more complicated than the first implant?
Revision care can involve extra planning to protect bone and soft tissue. We share a clear plan so you know the steps and rationale.
What are the alternatives if replacement isn’t possible?
Options may include bridges, partial dentures, or staged grafting before future implants. We explain pros and considerations for each.
Will it hurt?
Procedures are carried out with local anaesthetic and a calm pace. We also discuss comfort options tailored to your needs.
How much does failed implant treatment cost?
Costs depend on the findings and recommended steps. We provide a transparent breakdown after assessment rather than fixed figures upfront.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after implant consultation (/treatments/implants-consultation) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Often follows Implant consultation (/treatments/implants-consultation); 3D scans (/treatments/cbct-3d-scanning).
Alternatives we balance: Sedation dentistry (/treatments/sedation-dentistry); Aftercare and hygiene (/treatments/implants-aftercare).
Next steps we plan for: Implant placement (/treatments/implants); Teeth in a day (/treatments/implants-teeth-in-a-day); Implant restorations (/treatments/3d-implant-restorations).
