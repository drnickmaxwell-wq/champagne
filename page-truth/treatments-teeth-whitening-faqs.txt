Teeth whitening questions answered
Does whitening damage teeth?
When prescribed and monitored by a dentist using UK-regulated gels, whitening is safe for enamel. We assess for decay or gum issues first and use protective trays.
How white can teeth go?
We aim for a natural, even shade that suits your skin tone and enamel. Shade maps set a realistic range so we avoid over-whitening.
Does whitening affect veneers or crowns?
Existing crowns, veneers, and fillings will not lighten. We plan whitening first, then match or refresh restorations if needed.
How long does whitening last?
Results are maintained with good hygiene and occasional top-ups. We’ll guide you on a safe refresh schedule using your existing trays.
Is whitening part of a smile makeover?
Often yes. Whitening is the “B” in our Align, Bleach, Composite approach so colour is set before aligning teeth or adding bonding.

Teeth whitening FAQs
Dentist-led answers about whitening
Whitening is often surrounded by mixed advice online, so this page pulls the common questions into one clinically grounded place. We cover how whitening works, who it’s suitable for, what causes sensitivity, and how to approach whitening safely if you have gum recession, tooth wear, crowns or fillings. We also explain typical timelines, what “top-ups” actually mean, and how lifestyle factors such as coffee, tea and smoking affect stability of shade change. If you’re considering whitening as part of a wider smile plan, we’ll outline how it fits alongside aligners, bonding and veneers, so treatment is sequenced sensibly rather than rushed.
