Senior smile care FAQs
Common questions answered
Do you allow extra time for appointments?
Yes. We can book longer or staged visits so we can work gently, answer questions, and pace any treatment around your comfort.
What can you do for dry mouth or sensitivity?
We review medications and triggers, suggest targeted rinses or gels, and adjust cleaning techniques to keep teeth comfortable while protecting enamel.
Do existing crowns or bridges need replacing?
Not always. We check margins, bite, and supporting teeth. If they remain healthy, we focus on maintenance; if not, we explain repair or replacement options calmly.
Can dentures be made more secure?
Often yes. We can adjust or reline current dentures, consider chrome or PEEK frameworks, or discuss implant-retained options if suitable.
Are implants safe later in life?
Suitability depends on gum health, bone support, and medical factors. We assess these carefully and outline alternatives if implants are not the best option.
