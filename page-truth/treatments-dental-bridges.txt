Dental bridges in Shoreham-by-Sea
A dental bridge replaces one or more missing teeth by supporting a fixed tooth (or teeth) between neighbouring teeth or implants. Suitability depends on the health of the supporting teeth, gum condition, bite forces and the size and position of the gap. We assess the area carefully, because a bridge should feel stable, cleanable and comfortable in the long term. In some cases, an implant or a removable option may be more appropriate, particularly if the neighbouring teeth are intact. If a bridge is a good fit, we’ll explain material options, preparation, expected maintenance, and how to keep the margins healthy with daily cleaning.

Dental bridges
A dental bridge is a way of replacing one or more missing teeth by attaching a false tooth to neighbouring teeth.

A bridge can restore appearance and function, but it needs careful planning so it’s comfortable and predictable over the long term.

We’ll assess your teeth, gums, and bite and explain whether a bridge is suitable or whether other options may be more appropriate.

Digital accuracy
Scans that shape fit, bite, and hygiene access
Intraoral scanning records the prepared teeth, opposing bite, and soft tissue profile. The data helps the lab design pontics with natural emergence profiles and retainers that seat smoothly, reducing chairside adjustments and protecting the gums.

Dental bridge FAQs
Common questions about bridges
Do bridges look natural?
Bridges are made to match your other teeth in shape and shade, but the final appearance depends on the supporting teeth, gum contours, and the space being replaced. We’ll discuss what can be achieved for your situation.
How long do bridges last?
Lifespan varies with bite forces, cleaning, and the health of the supporting teeth and gums. With good maintenance and regular reviews, many bridges last for years, but we’ll outline the factors that affect longevity.
Will it feel strange at first?
It can feel different at first as your tongue and bite adjust. Most people adapt over time, and we can make adjustments if anything feels high or uncomfortable.
Can I eat normally?
Once you’re comfortable, most people return to normal eating. We may advise avoiding very hard foods or habits that put excess force on the bridge, especially early on.
Are implants an alternative?
Yes, implants can be an alternative when suitable, especially if the neighbouring teeth are healthy and you prefer not to prepare them. We’ll explain the pros, limits, timing, and costs so you can compare options.
