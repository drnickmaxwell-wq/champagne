Lost crowns, veneers or fillings
If a crown, veneer or filling has come out, it can feel urgent — especially if the tooth is sensitive or looks unfinished.

In many cases the tooth can be protected and repaired conservatively, but timing matters. A lost restoration can leave sharp edges, exposed dentine, or a tooth that is more likely to fracture.

We’ll assess what’s happened, explain the options clearly, and help you stabilise the tooth as simply as possible.
Protect the tooth and reduce sensitivity
Check for decay, cracks, or a cause for the failure
Decide whether it can be re-cemented or needs replacing
Restore comfort, function, and stability

=== SECTION: copy-block ===
Restorations can come loose for lots of reasons — wear over time, biting something hard, decay underneath, or the tooth changing shape.

Sometimes it’s a straightforward re-cement. Sometimes it’s a sign the tooth needs a different kind of protection.

If you still have the crown or veneer, keep it safe and bring it with you. We can often learn a lot from seeing it.

Why it’s worth seeing us promptly
When a restoration comes out, the underlying tooth is often more vulnerable than it looks.

Exposed dentine can be very sensitive, and the tooth can fracture more easily — especially if it’s already heavily filled. If there is decay or a crack underneath, delaying can reduce the options.

Seeing you early helps us protect the tooth, manage discomfort, and plan a repair that lasts.

What we can do
Possible treatments
The right solution depends on why the restoration came out and what the tooth looks like underneath.

Options may include re-cementing the existing crown or veneer (if it’s intact and the fit is still appropriate), replacing a filling, or making a new restoration if the tooth needs better protection.

If decay or a crack is present, we’ll explain the findings and the most sensible way to stabilise the tooth long-term.

Restoration FAQs
Can I eat before the appointment?
Sometimes, yes. If the crown is intact and the tooth underneath is healthy and stable, re-cementing can be a good option. If decay, a crack, or fit issues are present, replacing the crown may be safer long-term.
Will you reuse my crown or veneer?
In most cases, swallowed dental restorations pass through without causing harm. If you have breathing symptoms, chest pain, or you think it may have been inhaled, seek urgent medical advice. Either way, contact us so we can protect the tooth and plan the next step.
Is it urgent if I have no pain?
Temporary dental cements can sometimes help short-term, but they can also trap bacteria if used incorrectly. The safest approach is to keep the area clean, avoid chewing on that side, and call us. If you do use a temporary product, treat it as a short stop-gap, not a fix.
