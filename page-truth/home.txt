Dentistry planned carefully, delivered properly
Overview
St Mary’s House Dental Care is a long-established private practice in Shoreham-by-Sea. We focus on careful planning, calm delivery, and dentistry that makes sense for the long term.

We look after everyday oral health and also support complex cases involving tooth wear, missing teeth, implant-supported restorations, heavily restored mouths, and bite-related problems.

Appointments are structured so you understand what we’ve found, what it means, and what your realistic options are. If you’re anxious, short on time, or simply want things explained properly, we’ll take a measured approach and agree the next step together.

Who we are
Dentistry designed for clarity, comfort, and long-term confidence
Care at St Mary’s House is built around time, explanation, and respect for every patient’s circumstances.

We provide general, restorative, implant, orthodontic, and aesthetic dentistry, but we don’t rush decisions or push treatment. Appointments are unhurried, explanations are clear, and choices are made collaboratively.

Clinical philosophy
Care that values planning as much as precision
Good dentistry isn’t just about a single procedure. It’s about understanding bite, function, health, aesthetics, and long-term stability — and planning accordingly.

We take a conservative, evidence-led approach. When care becomes complex or irreversible — implants, extractions, root canal treatment, veneers, larger restorative plans — we slow things down, map out options clearly, and proceed step by step with your comfort and understanding at the centre.

Complex & multidisciplinary care
Structured care for complex situations
Many patients come to us after years of piecemeal dentistry, unresolved problems, or uncertainty about what should happen next. These cases need structure, not speed.

Our approach brings disciplines together — restorative, orthodontic, implant, and digital planning — so treatment is sequenced sensibly and reviewed carefully. For missing teeth, that may include implant-supported restorations or implant-retained dentures, planned with stability, comfort, and ease of maintenance in mind.

The aim is a clearer path forward before anything irreversible begins.

Local trust & continuity
Established care for Shoreham-by-Sea and surrounding communities
We’ve cared for patients from Shoreham-by-Sea and surrounding towns for many years. Many stay with us long-term — not because they need ongoing treatment, but because they value consistency and knowing who is looking after them.

Dentistry works best when your dentist understands your history, priorities, and concerns. That continuity matters whether you’re visiting for routine care, managing dental wear over time, or planning something more involved.

FAQ
Questions about the practice
I’m nervous about dental treatment. Is that a problem?
Not at all. Many people feel anxious about dental visits, and we’re used to working at a pace that feels comfortable. We explain what’s happening before we do anything, check in as we go, and adjust if you need a pause.
Will treatment hurt?
Comfort is always taken seriously. Local anaesthetic is used when needed, and nothing is rushed. Most patients are surprised by how manageable treatment feels when things are explained clearly and done at a measured pace.
Do I have to decide on treatment straight away?
No. In many cases, the first appointment is about understanding what’s going on and discussing options. You’re never expected to decide on the spot.
Do you do implants and complex restorative work?
Yes. We place and restore implants and also help patients who already have implants. Where treatment is complex or irreversible, planning and explanation come first so decisions are made carefully.
What if I just want advice or a second opinion?
That’s fine. Some patients come to us simply to understand their situation better before deciding what to do next. We’re happy to help with that.
Do you treat older patients?
Yes. Many of our patients are older and value a calmer, more considered approach. Continuity, explanation, and comfort are especially important in long-term care.

A clear, supportive first step
Your first visit is about listening, understanding your concerns, and gathering the information needed to guide you properly. You don’t need to know where to start. We’ll take things step by step.
