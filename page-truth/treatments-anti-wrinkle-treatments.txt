Facial therapeutics
Prescription anti-wrinkle treatments
Anti-wrinkle treatments are used to soften the appearance of certain facial lines by temporarily relaxing specific muscles that contribute to them over time.

These treatments are medical procedures and should be approached carefully. A thorough consultation is essential to assess suitability, discuss expectations, and explain how treatment works.

Our focus is on subtle, natural-looking outcomes that respect facial balance rather than dramatic change.
Assessment of facial movement and medical history before prescribing
Conservative dosing tailored to your goals and muscle activity
Review appointments to monitor comfort and refine only when safe

Consultation & prescribing
We prescribe only when treatment is appropriate
Anti-wrinkle treatments do not treat all types of facial lines and will not replace skin care, volume treatments, or surgical options where these are more appropriate.

As with any medical procedure, there are risks and possible side effects. These are discussed in full during consultation.

Treatment is only provided following appropriate assessment, discussion, and informed consent.
Full medical history, medicines, and contraindication checks
Facial mapping to balance doses and avoid brow or lid heaviness
Explanation of onset (usually several days) and duration (often up to 3–4 months)
Written aftercare and review scheduling before you leave

Consult, prescribe, treat, and review
Results are temporary and depend on your response. We avoid high doses or rushed top-ups to protect facial function.

Dose planning & technique
Mapped injection points for balanced results
We plan doses per muscle group, favouring multiple micro-injections to distribute medicine evenly. Needle gauge and depth are chosen to respect underlying vessels and avoid diffusion into unintended areas.

Anti-wrinkle FAQs
Common questions
How long do results last?
Results develop gradually and wear off over time. The duration varies between individuals, and we discuss realistic expectations during consultation.
Will I look frozen?
Our approach focuses on careful assessment and conservative dosing. The aim is a softer appearance while maintaining natural facial movement.
Does it hurt?
Most patients report brief pinpricks. Topical anaesthetic can be provided if needed, and we use fine needles to reduce discomfort.
Can I combine this with other treatments?
We often stage anti-wrinkle care with fillers, skin boosters, or polynucleotides when suitable. Sequencing is planned in consultation to keep safety first.
What if I decide not to continue?
Results wear off over time. We document doses so future care can be paused or adjusted without pressure.
