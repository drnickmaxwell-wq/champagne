Preventative dentistry FAQs
What patients ask most
How often should I come?
Most patients attend every 6 months, but we may suggest shorter or longer gaps based on gum health, decay risk, and how quickly plaque builds for you.
Do you check for mouth cancer?
Yes. Oral cancer screening is part of every exam. We review soft tissues, lymph areas, and any changes you’ve noticed.
I’m nervous — can you go slowly?
Absolutely. Tell us ahead of time and we’ll pace the visit, explain each step, and link you to our nervous patient support if helpful (/treatments/nervous-patients).
Is home whitening better?
Dentist-led whitening is usually safer and more predictable. We assess your teeth first and can advise on supervised home whitening through our whitening hub (/treatments/teeth-whitening).

Preventative & general dentistry
Prevention-first dentistry that keeps teeth for life
Preventative and general dentistry is about keeping problems small — or avoiding them altogether. A thorough check-up looks at teeth, gums, bite and soft tissues, alongside any symptoms or changes you’ve noticed. These visits help us spot early decay, gum inflammation and tooth wear before they become more complex to manage. Advice is tailored to your risk factors rather than generic rules, including daily cleaning technique, fluoride use, diet and habits that affect enamel and gum health. Where simple treatment is needed, we plan it carefully to keep teeth comfortable and easy to maintain, and we agree review intervals that suit your needs.
