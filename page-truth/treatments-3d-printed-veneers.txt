What they are
3D printed veneers in Shoreham-by-Sea
These are digitally designed veneer restorations created from medical-grade dental resin using high-precision 3D printing. They’re planned from detailed scans and smile design previews, then finished and fitted with a focus on comfort, fit, and a highly conservative approach where clinically appropriate.

Suitability varies — your bite, enamel quality, and long-term goals decide whether a printed resin restoration, ceramic veneer, or another option is the best match.

Porcelain veneers vs digitally designed / 3D printed veneers
Printed vs ceramic veneers — what’s different?
Ceramic (porcelain) veneers and digitally printed veneer restorations are made from different materials and produced in different ways. Ceramic veneers are a long-established option. Printed restorations use modern scanning and printing technology to create precise, ultra-thin restorations for carefully selected cases. The right choice depends on your bite, goals, and long-term plan — not one material ‘winning’ for everyone.

Digitally designed, 3D-printed veneer restorations
We offer advanced digitally designed veneer restorations using high-precision scanning and 3D printing technology. These restorations are custom designed from digital scans and printed from biocompatible dental resins used internationally in advanced restorative dentistry. The aim is a precise fit, controlled thickness, and a conservative approach — always guided by clinical judgement and careful case selection.
We outline when printed veneers are appropriate and when a ceramic route may be recommended.

Materials & craftsmanship
Materials and finishing
We use biocompatible dental resins supplied for regulated dental applications and process them strictly according to manufacturer instructions. The final restoration is then finished and polished by hand to refine shape, texture, and shine. If ceramic is the better option for your goals or bite, we’ll tell you clearly.

Printed veneer FAQs
What to consider before choosing printed veneers
How long do digitally designed or printed veneers last?
Longevity depends on bite forces, tooth position, habits such as grinding, and how the restorations are looked after. We’ll plan for durability and talk you through realistic expectations for your individual case.
What do printed veneers cost?
They are typically the most affordable veneer route. We explain how costs differ from composite bonding and porcelain so you can choose the right stage for you.
Who are printed veneers suitable for?
Suitability is decided after a full assessment of enamel, alignment, bite forces, and aesthetic goals. If printed veneer restorations aren’t right for you, we’ll recommend a better alternative.
What maintenance do printed veneers need?
Expect hygiene visits, occasional polishing, and night guard wear if you clench. Printed veneers can stain or wear sooner than porcelain, so refreshes are planned into your care.
Can I see the smile before committing?
Yes. Digital previews and printed mock sets let you assess length, symmetry, and shade. We can also discuss whitening or a combined smile makeover if that better matches your goals (/treatments/full-smile-makeover).
