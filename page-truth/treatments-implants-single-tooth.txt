Single-tooth implants
Replace one missing tooth with precision
A dental implant can be one way to replace a single missing tooth without relying on neighbouring teeth, unlike a traditional bridge. Planning starts with the end in mind: we assess the bite, gum shape, bone volume, and the position of adjacent teeth, then use CBCT and digital scans to plan implant placement to support a natural-looking crown. We’ll explain timing options, including immediate placement in selected cases, and discuss factors that affect predictability such as smoking, gum health, and tooth grinding. If an implant isn’t appropriate, we’ll outline alternatives such as a bridge or a removable option and help you choose a stable long-term solution.

Single implant FAQs
Common questions about replacing one tooth
How long does a single implant take?
Many cases take several months from placement to final crown, depending on healing and whether a temporary tooth is needed.
Will the implant match my other teeth?
We photograph and shade-map the neighbouring teeth so the final crown blends in shape, colour, and texture.
Can I have a temporary tooth?
We can often provide a provisional solution to maintain your smile while the implant integrates.
Does it hurt?
Placement uses local anaesthetic and gentle techniques; most patients describe pressure rather than pain, with soreness managed afterwards.
How do I care for the implant at home?
We show you how to brush and use cleaning aids around the implant to keep the gumline healthy.
Am I suitable for an implant?
We assess bone levels, gum health, and medical history in Shoreham-by-Sea to confirm if an implant is the safest choice.

Appropriate when you want to assess whether a single-tooth implant is appropriate for your missing tooth.
Often follows Implant consultation (/treatments/implants-consultation); CBCT 3D scanning (/treatments/cbct-3d-scanning).
Alternatives we balance: Bone grafting (/treatments/implants-bone-grafting); Sedation support (/treatments/implants-sedation).
Next steps we plan for: Implant restorations (/treatments/3d-implant-restorations); Hygiene and aftercare (/treatments/implants-aftercare); Retained denture options (/treatments/implants-retained-dentures).
