Care philosophy
Sara’s approach to dental hygiene is preventative, methodical and patient-focused. She believes effective periodontal care relies on understanding, consistency and realistic guidance that patients can apply between visits.

She takes time to explain findings clearly, discuss contributing factors and demonstrate techniques where helpful, allowing patients to feel informed rather than overwhelmed. Appointments are unhurried and adapted to individual comfort levels, with particular consideration given to patients who may feel nervous or sensitive.

Sara places strong emphasis on long-term maintenance, recognising that stable gum health is essential for both natural teeth and restorative work. Her aim is to support predictable, sustainable oral health outcomes through collaborative care and clear communication.
