Severe toothache and dental pain
Severe toothache can feel urgent, and it’s hard to think about anything else. Here in Shoreham-by-Sea, we see how quickly pain can disrupt sleep, eating, and work.

Pain relief can help you cope, but it doesn’t fix the underlying cause. Toothache can come from decay, infection, cracks, gum problems, grinding, or a filling or crown that’s failed.

We’ll assess what’s going on, explain what we can see, and recommend the most sensible way to settle pain and protect the tooth.

Toothache can range from mild twinges to severe, throbbing pain that disrupts sleep. If it’s persistent, worsening, or triggered by biting, heat, or cold, it’s worth getting checked even if it comes and goes.

We can talk through what’s happening and advise timing. If pain is getting worse, you notice swelling, fever, a bad taste, or you cannot open your mouth comfortably, call us promptly.

If you have rapid facial swelling, fever, difficulty swallowing, or breathing problems, seek urgent medical help immediately (A&E / 999) and then let us know as soon as you can.

Why assessment matters
Pain often means the tooth or surrounding tissues are under stress.

Painkillers and temporary measures can take the edge off, but they cannot resolve infection, nerve damage, or structural problems such as cracks or failed restorations. The safest route is a proper assessment so the right treatment is chosen for you.

Our aim is to diagnose the cause accurately, settle pain, and help you avoid repeat flare-ups.

What we can do
Possible treatments
At an emergency appointment we start with an assessment, look for the cause, and confirm a diagnosis with any checks or X-rays needed.

Where appropriate we provide immediate stabilisation to relieve pain and protect the tooth. Not all treatment is completed in one visit, so we’ll outline the next stages and timing.

Options may include replacing or repairing a filling, root canal treatment to treat infection inside the tooth, gum treatment, adjusting the bite, or in some cases removing a tooth that can’t be predictably saved.

We’ll explain the findings and the pros and cons of each option before anything is done.

Pain relief FAQs
Can I wait to see if the pain settles?
Sometimes pain eases for a while, but the cause may still be there. If pain is severe, waking you, lingering, or getting worse, it’s best to get advice promptly. Contact us and we’ll guide you on timing.
Will treatment be painful?
Our aim is to get you comfortable first. We use effective local anaesthetic and we work in a calm, step-by-step way. If you’re anxious, tell us — pacing, breaks, and clear explanation make a big difference.
What if the pain starts overnight?
Use normal pain relief if safe for you (follow the packet guidance), keep the area clean, and avoid chewing on that side. If you develop swelling, fever, or difficulty swallowing/breathing, seek urgent medical help. Contact us as soon as we’re open and we’ll advise next steps.
