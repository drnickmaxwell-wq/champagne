Composite bonding for measured smile refinement
Composite bonding (also called cosmetic bonding or dental bonding) uses layered resin to rebuild edges and balance shapes with minimal drilling. We preserve enamel wherever possible, plan conservatively, and explain how wear and staining can be managed over time.

Conservative improvements, well planned
Introduction
Composite bonding uses tooth-coloured resin to improve shape, close small gaps, repair chips, or soften uneven edges. It can often be done with minimal drilling, making it a conservative option when the bite and enamel are suitable. We begin with an assessment of wear, staining, gum health and bite forces, because those factors determine how predictable bonding will be over time. For some patients, whitening or aligner straightening first can improve the final result and reduce the amount of composite needed. If bonding is a good fit, we’ll explain what it can achieve, how it’s maintained, and what to expect with polishing and repairs.

Digital planning
Digitally planned and guided bonding
We start with 3D scans and photographs, design the proposed changes digitally, and share mock-ups so you can preview the direction. Guided placement and finishing maps keep the resin precise and consistent, and set up injection moulding when it is the safest choice.

Injection moulding technique
Injection moulded composite uses digital design and silicone or printed keys to deliver resin through a precise guide. It keeps edge lengths, embrasures, and widths consistent, improves symmetry across multiple teeth, and reduces chairside guesswork.
Digital scans and wax-ups map planned tooth shapes before treatment
Silicone keys or printed guides control resin volume for repeatable placement
Predictable edge lengths and contact points with fewer mid-appointment adjustments
Efficient when treating several teeth together or refining symmetry after orthodontics

Composite bonding FAQs
How long does composite bonding last?
With regular hygiene visits, polishing, and a night guard if you clench, many cases stay stable for several years before refreshes are needed.
Can composite bonding be repaired?
Yes. Chips or edge wear can usually be smoothed and re-layered without removing the rest of the bonding, keeping treatment conservative.
How do I maintain bonded teeth?
Use non-abrasive toothpaste, attend hygienist visits for polishing, minimise staining foods and smoking, and wear a night guard if advised.
Is composite bonding suitable for everyone?
Suitability depends on bite forces, enamel quality, and goals. We may recommend whitening, aligners, or veneers instead if the bite is heavy or colour change needed is significant.

Composite bonding for measured smile refinement
Composite bonding, sometimes called dental bonding, uses tooth-coloured resin in layers to rebuild edges and refine shape with minimal drilling. We aim to preserve enamel wherever possible, plan conservatively, and explain how wear and staining are managed over time.

Introduction
Conservative improvements, well planned
Composite bonding is a conservative cosmetic treatment that improves the appearance of teeth by adding tooth-coloured resin in controlled layers.

It is commonly used to refine shape, close small gaps, or repair minor chips. Because it usually involves little or no removal of natural tooth structure, it is a lower-intervention option than treatments that require more preparation.

Suitability depends on the condition of your teeth, your bite, and what you want to achieve. We assess these carefully before recommending treatment.

Digital planning
Digitally planned and guided bonding
We begin with 3D scans and clinical photographs, then design the proposed changes digitally. We share mock-ups so you can preview the direction. Guided placement and finishing maps help keep the resin precise and consistent, and support injection moulding when it offers the safest level of control.

Injection moulding technique
Injection moulded composite uses a digital design and silicone or printed guides to place resin accurately. This helps keep edge lengths, embrasures, and tooth widths consistent, improves symmetry across multiple teeth, and reduces variation during placement.

Composite bonding FAQs
How long does composite bonding last?
Composite bonding can last for several years, but it is not permanent. Over time the material can wear, stain, or chip, and maintenance may be needed.
Can composite bonding be repaired?
Yes. Chips or edge wear can usually be repaired by smoothing and adding new resin, without removing the rest of the bonding.
Is composite bonding better than veneers?
It depends on your teeth, your bite, and your goals. Bonding is more conservative, while veneers can offer greater durability or larger shape changes. We explain which option is most appropriate for your situation.
Does composite bonding damage teeth?
Bonding is usually carried out with minimal or no removal of tooth structure. We assess your enamel and bite beforehand to ensure it is suitable.
