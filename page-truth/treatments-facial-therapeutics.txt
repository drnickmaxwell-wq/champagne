Facial therapeutics FAQs
Common questions
Do I need a consultation before any treatment?
Yes. We only proceed after a clinical assessment that reviews your medical history, medicines, and symptoms, then confirms whether conservative care or injectables are appropriate.
Are therapeutic injectables the same as cosmetic toxin treatments?
No. Here they are used for symptom relief in carefully selected muscles, not for cosmetic aims. Doses, targets, and follow-up are chosen for function and comfort.
What if conservative steps are enough?
If self-care, guards, or physiotherapy resolve symptoms, we continue monitoring without injectables. Medicine is only added when clinically beneficial.
When should I seek urgent care?
Contact us or emergency services if you notice jaw locking, severe swelling, breathing changes, or visual symptoms after any facial treatment.
Who delivers the treatment?
A prescriber trained in facial anatomy, complication management, and escalation pathways carries out your care and remains available for review.
