Contact St Mary’s House Dental Care
Getting in touch should feel straightforward.

Whether you’d like to arrange an appointment, ask a question, or talk something through before deciding what to do next, our team will help guide you calmly and clearly.

There’s no obligation to proceed with treatment simply by contacting us. Many people get in touch because they want to understand their options, what an initial appointment involves, or whether something sounds urgent.

We’re a private dental practice based in Shoreham-by-Sea, and we see patients with a wide range of concerns — from routine check-ups to more complex dental problems.

If you feel unsure, or it’s been a while since you last saw a dentist, that’s very common. Let us know when you contact us and we can take things at a pace that feels manageable.

How to contact us
You’re welcome to contact the practice by phone or by using the enquiry form on this page.

If your question is straightforward, our reception team can usually help directly. If it’s more clinical, we’ll make sure it’s passed to the right person.

Messages are read during normal opening hours and we aim to respond as promptly as we can. Email and online enquiries aren’t suitable for urgent dental problems.

Any information provided before an appointment is general in nature and can’t replace a clinical assessment. Treatment recommendations, where appropriate, are only made after we’ve seen you and discussed your individual circumstances.
