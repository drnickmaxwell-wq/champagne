Broken, chipped or cracked teeth
If you’ve chipped a tooth, cracked a corner, or something feels sharp or painful, it’s worth getting it checked promptly.

Some problems look small but involve deeper cracks or exposed dentine, which can lead to sensitivity, infection, or a larger fracture.

We’ll assess what’s happened, explain what we can see, and recommend the least invasive repair that keeps the tooth stable.
Quick smoothing to prevent cuts to cheeks or tongue
Temporary coverings where needed
Assessment for structural stability
Clear plan for lasting repairs

Teeth can chip or crack for lots of reasons — biting something hard, an old filling giving way, grinding, or an accident.

Sometimes it’s mainly cosmetic. Sometimes it’s an early warning that the tooth is under stress.

If you’re unsure, we’d rather you call and ask. We can advise whether it sounds urgent and what to do in the meantime.

Why it’s worth checking
A chip or crack isn’t always an emergency, but it can change quickly.

Small fractures can spread, and exposed dentine can become very sensitive. In some cases, cracks allow bacteria to reach the nerve, leading to infection.

Seeing you early gives us more conservative options — and helps prevent the problem turning into a bigger repair.

What we can do
Possible treatments
Treatment depends on where the crack is, how deep it goes, and how much tooth is missing.

Options may include smoothing a sharp edge, a bonded repair (composite), replacing or reshaping an old filling, or protecting the tooth with an onlay or crown.

If the nerve is involved, root canal treatment may be needed — but we only recommend that when it’s clearly indicated.

Cracked tooth FAQs
Can a chipped tooth wait?
Sometimes a small chip can wait a short time, but it’s best to get advice. Chips can expose dentine, increase sensitivity, or develop into a larger fracture. Call us and we’ll guide you on timing.
Will I need a crown straight away?
Not always. We usually start with the least invasive repair that keeps the tooth stable. That may be smoothing, a bonded repair, or replacing a filling. A crown or onlay is recommended when the tooth needs extra protection.
Is it safe to keep eating?
Try to avoid chewing on the affected side until we’ve assessed the tooth. Softer foods and careful cleaning help. If biting triggers sharp pain, stop and contact us as that can suggest a deeper crack.
