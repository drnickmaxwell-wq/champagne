Dental extractions
A dental extraction involves the removal of a tooth that cannot be maintained comfortably or predictably over the long term.

Extractions are usually considered only when other options are unlikely to succeed or would not offer a stable long-term outcome.

At St Mary’s House Dental Care, the focus is always on preserving teeth where possible and recommending extraction only when it’s genuinely in a patient’s best interest.

Technology & precision
What an extraction involves
Dental extractions are carried out under local anaesthetic.

Once the area is numb, the tooth is removed carefully, with the aim of minimising trauma to surrounding tissues.

The procedure itself is usually straightforward, although complexity can vary depending on the tooth and its position.

Risks, limits & alternatives
Aftercare and healing
After an extraction, it’s important to allow the area to heal properly.

This may involve avoiding certain foods, keeping the area clean, and following specific instructions to reduce the risk of complications.

We’ll explain what’s normal during healing and when to get in touch if concerns arise.

Replacing a missing tooth
If a tooth is removed, options for replacement may be discussed.

These can include leaving the space, using a denture, placing a bridge, or considering a dental implant, depending on the situation.

Any replacement is planned carefully and never rushed.

Extraction & surgery FAQs
Questions and reassurance
Being told a tooth needs to be removed can feel daunting.

If you’re unsure why an extraction has been suggested or what it means for you, we encourage you to ask. Clear explanations help support confident, informed decisions.
How long is recovery?
Most people are comfortable after a few days with steady improvement over 1–2 weeks. We give written instructions to support smooth healing.
Can the tooth be replaced?
Yes. We will discuss timing for implants, bridges, or dentures once the area is stable, and we can provide provisional solutions if needed.
What if the tooth could be saved?
If a filling, crown, or root canal could provide a predictable result, we’ll explain that option first so you can make an informed choice.
