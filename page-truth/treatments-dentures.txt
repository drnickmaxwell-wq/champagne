Dentures & tooth replacement
Dentures
Dentures are removable appliances designed to replace missing teeth and support everyday function.

They can restore appearance, support speech and chewing, and help maintain facial structure where teeth have been lost over time.

At St Mary’s House Dental Care, dentures are planned carefully, with a focus on comfort, function, and realistic expectations.

Types of dentures
Dentures are removable appliances used to replace missing teeth and restore basic function, appearance, and comfort.

They are one of several options for managing tooth loss and can be appropriate in many situations, particularly where fixed solutions are not suitable or preferred. The right approach depends on your oral health, expectations, and day-to-day needs.

Understanding what dentures can realistically provide — and where their limits are — helps you decide whether they fit your life, not just your mouth.
Partial dentures fit around remaining teeth for targeted replacement.

Planning and fit
Successful dentures rely on careful planning and accurate fit.

=== SECTION: treatment.technology ===
Comfort and adjustment
Dentures need daily cleaning and regular checks to keep them fitting well and to protect the health of the gums underneath.

They should be removed for cleaning and usually at night to allow the tissues to rest. Over time, changes in the gums and jaw can affect fit, even if the dentures themselves are undamaged.

Routine reviews help catch small issues early, before comfort or fit becomes a problem.

Questions and reassurance
Will I be able to eat with dentures?
Eating with dentures usually takes time to adjust. Most people adapt, but certain foods can remain more challenging, especially at first. We provide guidance and review fit to improve comfort and stability.

Alternatives and limitations
Dentures are not the only way to replace missing teeth.

Depending on your situation, alternatives such as bridges or dental implants may be discussed.

Each option has benefits and limitations, and we’ll help you weigh these up realistically.
