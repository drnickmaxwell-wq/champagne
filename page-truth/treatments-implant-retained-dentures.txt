Implant-retained dentures FAQs
Implant-retained dentures can offer improved stability compared to conventional dentures, but they are not the same as fixed teeth.

These FAQs address common questions about how they work, who they may suit, and what day-to-day life is like, so you can understand whether this option makes sense for you.

They are often considered a middle ground between conventional dentures and fully fixed implant teeth.

HOW IT WORKS
How implant-retained dentures work
Implant-retained dentures use a small number of implants to help stabilise a denture, making it more secure, more comfortable, and easier to manage day-to-day. This approach improves stability while keeping maintenance manageable. They are often considered a middle ground between conventional dentures and fully fixed implant teeth.

Common questions about implant-retained dentures
How are they cleaned and maintained?
Cleaning involves removing the denture, cleaning it thoroughly, and cleaning around the implants in the mouth.

We’ll explain practical techniques and review them regularly to help prevent problems.

Attachments and components may need periodic replacement as part of normal maintenance.
How many implants are needed?
The number of implants is planned after assessment and scans, often fewer than a full fixed bridge requires while still providing reliable support.
Are they removable?
Many implant-retained dentures are designed to be removed for daily cleaning while staying secure during eating and speaking. Suitability depends on your specific plan.
Will they feel bulky?
The denture is crafted to balance stability with comfort. We review fit and make adjustments so it feels as natural and streamlined as possible.
Does the procedure hurt?
Implant placement is carried out with local anaesthetic and a calm approach. Some pressure and post-treatment soreness are expected, with clear guidance to keep you comfortable.
How long do they last?
Implants are intended for long-term use, but longevity depends on healing, home care, and attending regular reviews to monitor implant health and denture fit.
How much does treatment cost?
Costs are discussed after a full assessment and planning stage, with transparent explanations of options so you know the investment before deciding.
Can I upgrade later to a fixed bridge?
In some cases additional planning allows a transition to a fixed bridge later. We confirm if that pathway is realistic once we understand your bone health and goals.
