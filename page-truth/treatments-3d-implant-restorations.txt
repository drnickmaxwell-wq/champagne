What it is
Digital workflows for stable implant crowns and bridges
We merge scans, CBCT data, and bite records to design implant restorations that follow your tissue profile and occlusion. Printing or milling is used according to the indication, with porcelain or lab ceramics recommended when they high standards support longevity.
Emergence profiles shaped to your gumline
Contacts mapped to balance forces and hygiene
Materials chosen for strength, wear, and shade
Chairside adjustments planned before your fit visit
Clear maintenance guidance after placement

Technology
Scans, CBCT insight, and guided finishing
We combine intraoral scans, CBCT imaging when indicated, and digital occlusion mapping to shape restorations before they reach the mouth. Materials are selected for their regulated indications and finished under clinician supervision.

Implant restoration FAQs
Planning, fit, and materials
Can I see the design before it is made?
Yes. We share digital previews and, where useful, printed mock-ups so you can understand contours and contacts.
Do you often print these restorations?
We select printing, milling, or lab ceramics based on strength, aesthetics, and your long-term needs. Porcelain or hybrid ceramics may be recommended for higher-load cases.
How do you check the bite?
We map contacts digitally and verify them at the fit appointment, making measured refinements to protect the implant and surrounding teeth.
What follow-up is needed?
You’ll have scheduled reviews to monitor tissues, contacts, and wear. We also outline home care to keep the restoration clean.
Are the materials regulated?
Yes. We use regulated dental materials selected for their intended indications and explain their maintenance and lifespan.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after implant placement (/treatments/implants) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Appropriate when you want to explore how 3d planning supports implant restorations and fit.
Often follows Implant placement (/treatments/implants); Implant consultation (/treatments/implants-consultation).
Alternatives we balance: CBCT verification (/treatments/cbct-3d-scanning); Sedation support (/treatments/implants-sedation).
Next steps we plan for: Crown and bridge fitting (/treatments/dental-crowns); Hygiene and maintenance (/treatments/implants-aftercare); Digital smile refinement (/treatments/digital-smile-design).
