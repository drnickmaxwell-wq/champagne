Retainers
Retainers help keep teeth in their corrected positions after orthodontic treatment. Without retention, teeth naturally drift over time, even after a good result. We’ll advise on the most suitable retainer type — removable, fixed, or a combination — based on your bite, alignment and long-term stability needs. We also explain wear schedules, cleaning and what to watch for if a retainer starts to feel tight or loose. Regular checks allow us to confirm fit and function, because retainers can wear or distort gradually. The aim is stable alignment that stays comfortable and easy to maintain.

Overview
Why retainers matter
After teeth are moved, the supporting tissues take time to adapt.

Without retention, small changes can gradually build into noticeable relapse. This isn’t a sign that treatment has ‘failed’ — it’s a normal biological tendency.

Changes in bite and tooth position can continue throughout adult life, not just immediately after orthodontic treatment.

The aim is to maintain stability and reduce the need for repeat treatment later.
