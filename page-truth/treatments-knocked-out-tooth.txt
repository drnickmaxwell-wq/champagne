Knocked-out tooth
A knocked-out adult tooth can sometimes be saved, but timing and handling matter.

If you can get advice immediately, bring the tooth with you and avoid touching the root. If it’s safe to do so, gentle first aid can improve the chances of a good outcome — but it isn’t always possible in real life, especially after an accident.

Call us straight away so we can guide you on what to do next and how urgently you need to be seen.
Act quickly — time matters
Handle the tooth carefully (avoid the root)
Keep it moist and protected
Get assessed promptly for the best chance of stabilisation

Having a tooth knocked out is frightening — and it often happens alongside a fall, collision, or sports injury.

If the tooth is an adult tooth, there may be a chance of replantation depending on timing and what’s happened to the tooth and socket.

If you’re unsure whether it’s a baby tooth or an adult tooth, or there are other injuries, call us and we’ll guide you to the safest next step.

Why speed matters
The tissues that help an adult tooth reattach can be damaged quickly if the tooth dries out or is handled roughly.

Even with prompt care, replantation isn’t always possible or successful — but early assessment usually gives the best chance of stabilising the situation and planning next steps.

We’ll also check for associated injuries, fractures, and whether nearby teeth have been damaged or loosened.

What we can do
Possible treatments
Treatment depends on whether the tooth is an adult tooth, how long it has been out, how it has been stored, and the condition of the socket and surrounding bone.

Options may include careful replantation and stabilisation (splinting) where appropriate, monitoring healing, and follow-up assessment. In some situations, replacement options are discussed if replantation isn’t possible.

We’ll explain the likely risks, the aftercare required, and what long-term maintenance might involve.

Knocked-out tooth FAQs
Can a baby tooth be replanted?
Usually no. Baby (primary) teeth are not normally replanted because doing so can damage the developing adult tooth underneath. If you’re unsure whether it’s a baby or adult tooth, call us and we’ll advise quickly.
What if the tooth looks damaged?
If the tooth is broken, cracked, or has obvious contamination, replantation may be less suitable — but it depends on the situation. Keep the tooth safe and moist, avoid touching the root, and contact us so we can assess what’s realistic.
Do I need a tetanus check?
If the injury involved a dirty wound, soil, or a cut that may have been contaminated, a tetanus check may be sensible. If you’re unsure, contact your GP, NHS 111, or urgent care for advice — and still contact us so we can deal with the dental side promptly.
