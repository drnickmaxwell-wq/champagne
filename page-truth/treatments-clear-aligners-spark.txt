How Spark clear aligners work
Discreet trays planned for comfort and predictability
Spark aligners use gentle, staged trays to guide teeth into place. Each step is planned from your digital scans, so you understand expected movements, attachments, and how progress checks keep things on track, alongside plans for whitening (/treatments/teeth-whitening) or veneers (/treatments/veneers) if you want to refine shade and shape after movement.

Spark FAQs
Answers before you start
How long does treatment take?
Timelines vary by case complexity. Many Spark plans run for several months to over a year; we share your projected timeframe after reviewing your scans.
Does it hurt?
You may feel pressure or mild tenderness for a few days when changing trays. Clinician-led planning and regular reviews keep discomfort managed.
How often are reviews?
We book progress checks every few weeks to confirm fit, hygiene, and movement, adjusting the plan if something needs refining.
Can I eat anything?
Remove your aligners for meals and hot drinks. With trays out, you can eat normally—just brush before putting them back to protect clarity and gums.
What if I lose an aligner?
Contact us quickly. We’ll advise whether to move to the next tray, step back to the previous one, or order a replacement based on your stage.
Are attachments needed?
Many Spark plans use small tooth-coloured attachments to guide precise movement. We explain where they may sit and how visible they’ll be before starting.
Is Spark suitable for complex cases?
Some complex movements may need fixed orthodontics. We assess candidacy with digital scans and let you know if Spark can safely achieve your goals.
