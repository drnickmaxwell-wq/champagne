Tooth wear and erosion
Tooth wear refers to the gradual loss of tooth structure over time.

It’s a common issue and often develops slowly, meaning many people don’t notice it until changes in shape, sensitivity, or appearance become more obvious.

At St Mary’s House Dental Care, tooth wear is managed thoughtfully, with an emphasis on understanding why it’s happening before deciding how to treat it.

Assessment
Why careful assessment matters
Understanding the cause and pattern of wear helps guide appropriate management.

Assessment may include examining how teeth meet, looking for signs of muscle activity, reviewing diet and habits, and checking for changes over time.

Not all wear requires immediate treatment, but monitoring is important.
