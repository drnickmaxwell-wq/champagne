The Wand FAQs
Common comfort questions
How is The Wand different from a syringe?
It uses computer-controlled flow and slim tips to deliver anaesthetic steadily, reducing sudden pressure.
Will it make my appointment longer?
The start may be slower to prioritise comfort, but it’s planned into your appointment time.
Can it be combined with sedation?
Yes, when suitable. We discuss whether sedation dentistry or other calming support is appropriate first.
Is it safe for emergency visits?
Yes, we can use it in emergency care when time allows. You’ll still receive standard safety checks.
What if I still feel nervous?
Tell us. We can pause, adjust, or explore additional calming options, including referrals to nervous patient resources.
