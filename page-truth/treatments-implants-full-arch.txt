Full arch implants
Full arch implant rehabilitation in Shoreham-by-Sea
Full-arch implant treatment is designed for people with failing teeth or missing teeth who want a stable fixed option across an entire jaw. It is not one single procedure — it’s a staged plan that may involve extractions, managing infection or gum disease, careful bite planning, and deciding whether immediate fixed teeth are appropriate. We use CBCT scans and digital planning to map bone and anatomy, then design implant positions to support a predictable final bridge. We’ll explain timelines, temporary options, maintenance requirements, and what factors affect suitability such as smoking, diabetes control, tooth grinding and bone volume. If full-arch implants aren’t right for you, we’ll outline other stable alternatives.

What is a full-arch implant bridge?
Fixed teeth supported by carefully placed implants
A full-arch solution secures a custom bridge to a small number of implants (often four to six), giving a fixed alternative to loose dentures. It restores bite stability, supports clearer speech, and feels more comfortable when cleaned and maintained correctly over the long term.

Full-arch implant FAQs
Your questions about fixed full-arch treatment
Is it the same day?
Some cases allow a provisional bridge on the day of surgery, but this depends on bone quality, bite, and stability; we confirm timing during planning.
Will I be without teeth?
We aim to provide immediate or next-day provisional teeth so you are not left without a smile; if staging is safer, we discuss temporary alternatives.
All-on-4 vs All-on-6?
Both use strategically placed implants to support a full bridge. The number of implants is planned around your bone volume, bite forces, and long-term maintenance needs.
Is it painful?
Treatment is carried out with local anaesthetic and gentle techniques, with sedation available for suitable cases. Expect pressure and post-surgery soreness that we manage with clear aftercare.
How do I clean under the bridge?
We demonstrate brushes, floss aids, and water flossers to clean under the bridge and around implants, and we review your routine at hygiene visits.
How long does it last?
Implants and bridges are designed for long-term function, but longevity relies on healthy gums, controlled bite forces, and consistent maintenance.
What if I grind my teeth?
We assess your bite and may recommend night protection or design adjustments to safeguard the bridge if you clench or grind.
How much does it cost?
Costs are confirmed after a full assessment and tailored plan, with finance options discussed so you understand the investment before starting.
