What they are
Chrome cobalt partial dentures designed for stability
Chrome dentures are removable partial dentures made with a thin metal framework that supports replacement teeth.

They are used where precision, stability, and longevity matter — particularly when several natural teeth remain and can help support the denture. Chrome dentures are not simply an upgraded version of acrylic dentures; they are a different design approach with specific advantages and responsibilities.

Understanding how they work, and when they are appropriate, is essential before deciding whether this option suits you.

Materials & fit
Rigid support with careful design
Compared with acrylic dentures, chrome dentures are generally more rigid and stable.

They tend to feel less bulky in the mouth, but the metal framework does not flex in the same way as acrylic. This rigidity can improve function, but it also means comfort depends heavily on accurate design and the health of the supporting teeth.

Chrome dentures are not always more comfortable by default — the outcome depends on careful assessment and planning.

FAQs
Understanding chrome dentures
Will metal show when I smile?
We design clasp positions and tooth shades to stay discreet. In some cases we can use tooth-coloured clasps; we’ll show you options before fitting.
Are chrome dentures better than acrylic?
They are different rather than simply better. Chrome frameworks are thinner and more rigid, while acrylic is more flexible. The right choice depends on your remaining teeth, fit needs, and long-term goals.
How long do chrome dentures last?
Chrome frameworks can last for many years, but longevity depends on fit, oral health, and how the supporting teeth change over time. Regular reviews help keep them comfortable.
What if I need more stability later?
We can revisit fit, clasp tension, or consider implant support if you want reduced movement. Any step is planned with your comfort and timeline in mind.
