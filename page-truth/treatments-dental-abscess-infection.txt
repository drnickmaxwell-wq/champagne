Dental abscess and infection
A dental abscess is an infection that can build pressure and cause significant pain, swelling, or a bad taste.

Sometimes symptoms come and go, but the underlying infection usually needs proper assessment and treatment. Leaving it can allow the infection to spread and can make the tooth harder to save.

If you have facial swelling, difficulty swallowing, fever, or you feel generally unwell, seek urgent advice and contact us as soon as possible.
Assess the cause and how urgent it is
Reduce pain and pressure safely
Treat infection appropriately (not just symptoms)
Plan the most sensible long-term fix

=== SECTION: copy-block ===
Infections can start quietly — sometimes as a dull ache, sometimes as sensitivity, and sometimes with no pain until swelling appears.

An abscess can come from the tooth nerve, from gum disease, or from a crack or deep decay letting bacteria in.

If you’re unsure whether it’s an emergency, call us. We can advise on urgency and what to do while you’re waiting to be seen.

Why it needs proper assessment
Infections are not always solved by antibiotics alone. Antibiotics may be appropriate in certain situations, but the source of the infection usually needs treating.

That might mean draining the infection, cleaning and sealing the tooth with root canal treatment, treating gum infection, or removing a tooth that cannot be saved.

Our job is to assess the cause, explain the realistic options, and help you get stable quickly — then plan longer-term care calmly.

What we can do
Possible treatments
Treatment depends on where the infection is coming from and how advanced it is.

Options may include local measures to relieve pressure, root canal treatment to save a tooth, periodontal (gum) treatment, or extraction where the tooth cannot be predictably restored.

If antibiotics are needed, we’ll explain why, what they can and can’t do, and what follow-up is required.

Infection FAQs
Do I always need antibiotics?
Sometimes antibiotics are necessary, especially if there is spreading swelling or you are unwell. But an abscess usually needs the source treated as well — for example drainage, root canal treatment, gum treatment, or extraction. We’ll advise what’s appropriate after assessment.
Will the swelling go away on its own?
Symptoms can ease if an abscess drains, but the infection often remains and can flare again. Leaving it can increase risk of spread and reduce the chance of saving the tooth. It’s safest to get it assessed.
Can I work or travel after treatment?
Facial swelling can be serious. Contact us urgently. If you have fever, difficulty swallowing, or breathing problems, seek urgent medical help immediately (A&E / 999) and then update us as soon as you can.

Why it needs proper assessment
Infections are not always solved by antibiotics alone. Antibiotics can be appropriate in some situations, but the source of infection usually still needs treating.

That might mean draining the infection, cleaning and sealing the tooth with root canal treatment, treating gum infection, or removing a tooth that cannot be saved.

Our job is to assess the cause, explain the realistic options, and help you stabilise quickly — then plan longer-term care in a calm, sensible way.

Possible treatments
Treatment depends on where the infection is coming from and how advanced it is.

Options may include local measures to relieve pressure, root canal treatment to try to save a tooth, periodontal (gum) treatment, or extraction when the tooth cannot be predictably restored.

If antibiotics are needed, we’ll explain why, what they can and can’t do, and what follow-up is required.
