What they are
Custom acrylic dentures with staged checks
Acrylic dentures are removable dentures made from a lightweight acrylic material and are commonly used to replace missing teeth.

They are often chosen because they are adaptable, cost-effective, and suitable in a wide range of clinical situations. Like all dentures, they involve compromise, and understanding how they function in everyday life is key to deciding whether they are the right option for you.

Before any recommendation is made, we focus on how acrylic dentures would fit your mouth, your expectations, and your day-to-day needs.

Materials & fit
Lightweight bases with clinician-guided adjustments
Acrylic dentures need daily cleaning to remove plaque and food debris and to protect the health of the gums.

They should be removed for cleaning and usually overnight to allow the tissues to rest. Acrylic can wear or change fit over time as the mouth changes, even if the denture itself appears intact.

Regular reviews help ensure comfort is maintained and allow small adjustments to be made when needed.

FAQs
Answering common questions
How long do acrylic dentures last?
Acrylic dentures can last for years, but fit and function change as the mouth changes. Relines, repairs, or replacement may be needed over time.
Will acrylic dentures feel bulky?
Acrylic dentures can feel bulkier at first, and it takes time to adapt. We adjust the fit and outline what to expect during the settling-in period.
Can acrylic dentures be repaired?
Yes, repairs are often possible if a denture chips or fractures. We’ll explain how to protect them and what to do if damage occurs.
Do I need adhesive?
Some patients use a small amount for reassurance, especially for lower dentures. We prioritise fit first and discuss implant support if you want more stability.
