CBCT / 3D scanning
CBCT and 3D dental scanning
Three-dimensional scanning allows us to see dental structures in more detail than traditional two-dimensional X-rays.

CBCT (cone beam computed tomography) provides a 3D view of teeth, bone, nerves, and surrounding anatomy. It’s used selectively, when additional information genuinely helps with diagnosis or planning.

At St Mary’s House Dental Care, CBCT scanning is used to support careful decision-making — not as a routine step for every patient.

What CBCT shows
What 3D scanning shows that standard X-rays don’t
Unlike traditional X-rays, CBCT scans show structures in three dimensions.

This can help us assess bone thickness and shape, the position of nerves and sinuses, the extent of infection or fractures, and how teeth relate to surrounding structures.

Having this information upfront helps reduce uncertainty and improve planning accuracy.

How results are used
How scan results are used
Scan results are used to support diagnosis and planning — not to replace clinical judgement.

They may help confirm whether treatment is appropriate, refine the proposed approach, or highlight situations where an alternative plan is safer.

We’ll explain what the scan shows and how it influences recommendations.

Questions or concerns
Understanding when scanning is needed
Why might a CBCT scan be recommended?
CBCT scanning is advised when standard X-rays don’t provide enough information, such as implant planning, complex extractions, impacted teeth, or ongoing symptoms after root treatment.
Do I need a CBCT scan for every problem?
Not every dental problem requires 3D imaging. If standard X-rays and clinical examination provide sufficient information, a CBCT scan won’t be recommended.
How are scan results used?
Results support diagnosis and planning, helping confirm whether treatment is appropriate, refine the proposed approach, or highlight when an alternative plan is safer.
Can I ask about radiation and safety?
Yes. We follow UK guidance on justification and exposure, use settings that minimise dose, and are happy to discuss radiation levels before proceeding.
What happens during the scan?
You’ll stand or sit still while the scanner rotates briefly around your head. The scan takes seconds and is non-invasive, with no contact or discomfort.

Questions or concerns
If you’re unsure why a CBCT scan has been suggested, or whether it’s necessary, we encourage you to ask.

Understanding the reason for any investigation is an important part of informed decision-making.
