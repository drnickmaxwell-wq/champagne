Clear aligners with clear diagnosis
Introduction
Clear aligners straighten teeth using a series of custom trays that move teeth in small, planned steps. The key is diagnosis and planning: we assess your bite, gum health, tooth wear and any jaw symptoms, then use digital scans to model movement and discuss what’s realistic. Aligners can help with crowding, spacing and some bite corrections, but not every case is suitable — and retention is essential to keep results stable. We’ll also discuss where aligners fit alongside whitening, bonding or restorative work, especially if you’re planning a broader smile refresh. If aligners are recommended, you’ll receive a clear timeline, check-in plan and aftercare guidance.

How clear aligners work
Gentle, staged movements mapped in advance
Clear aligners use a series of custom trays to guide teeth into position. Each stage is planned digitally, so you know the expected movements, check-in cadence, and how to care for trays day to day, with options to align shade through whitening (/treatments/teeth-whitening) or plan veneers (/treatments/veneers) once alignment is stable.

Aligner FAQs
Answers before you decide
How much do clear aligners cost?
Fees depend on complexity and length of treatment; we outline a range after assessing your teeth and the expected number of stages.
How long will I wear aligners?
Most mild to moderate cases run for several months to over a year; we share a projected timeline and review it at each check-in.
Will aligners hurt?
You may feel pressure or mild soreness for a few days when switching trays; it typically eases with consistent wear.
Can I eat and drink with aligners in?
Remove aligners for meals and anything other than still water to avoid staining or warping the trays.
What are attachments?
Small tooth-coloured bumps that help guide movement. We explain placement, visibility, and care before adding them.
Will I speak differently?
Some patients notice a slight lisp for a few days. Speech usually settles as you adapt to the trays.
What if I lose an aligner?
Contact the clinic quickly. We’ll advise whether to move to the next tray, use a previous one, or order a replacement.
Do I need retainers after treatment?
Yes. Retainers hold your new tooth positions and reduce relapse risk. We’ll agree a wear schedule and maintenance plan.

When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after routine check-ups and hygiene (/treatments/preventative-and-general-dentistry) so the plan stays safe and measured.
