Mouthguards & retainers
Protect teeth from sport, grinding, or post-orthodontic movement
Mouthguards and retainers have different jobs, but both rely on precise fit to work properly. A custom mouthguard protects teeth and soft tissues during sport by distributing impact forces, while a retainer helps maintain tooth position after orthodontic treatment. We assess your bite, lifestyle needs and any existing dental work, then use impressions or digital scans to create an appliance that’s secure, comfortable and easy to clean. Regular review matters because appliances can wear, distort or stop fitting well as teeth change. The aim is predictable protection and long-term stability, not a quick off-the-shelf compromise.

FAQs
Questions about mouthguards and retainers
How long do guards or retainers last?
Longevity depends on wear and bite forces. We will show you how to spot thinning or cracks and advise when to replace or adjust.
Can I choose between lab-made and 3D printed?
Yes. We recommend the material based on durability, comfort, and how your bite loads the device, then confirm your preference.
How do I clean and store them?
Use lukewarm water, non-abrasive cleaning aids, and a ventilated case. Avoid hot water or harsh chemicals that distort the fit.
What if my retainer feels tight?
Mild tightness after a break can be normal. If pressure is painful or teeth have shifted, contact us for a review before continuing.
