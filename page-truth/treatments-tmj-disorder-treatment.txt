Your clinician reviews symptoms, examines joint range and clicks, and checks bite stability. Imaging or referral is arranged when findings suggest structural change. We co-create a plan that starts conservatively and respects your comfort.
History of locking, noise, and pain episodes
Examination of opening range, deviations, and muscle tenderness
Guard options, bite adjustments, and stretching protocols explained
When therapeutic injectables may support muscle-related symptoms

TMJ disorder FAQs
Common questions
Do I always need imaging?
No. Imaging is recommended when symptoms, history, or examination suggest structural joint changes or atypical findings.
Will exercises alone help?
Exercises and habit change often improve symptoms. Guards, adjustments, or medicines are considered when exercises are insufficient or risk of damage is present.
What if my jaw locks?
Intermittent locking is assessed in clinic. Sudden inability to open or close, severe pain, or swelling warrants urgent contact or emergency care.
Are injectables used for TMJ disorders?
Only in selected cases after conservative steps. Doses are tailored to relieve muscle overactivity rather than cosmetic aims.
How long does treatment take?
Timelines vary; we review progress regularly and adjust the plan based on symptoms, guard wear, and any specialist feedback.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after facial pain investigations (/treatments/facial-pain-and-headache) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Appropriate when you want to explore assessment and management options for tmj disorders.
Often follows Facial pain investigations (/treatments/facial-pain-and-headache); Grinding and clenching review (/treatments/bruxism-and-jaw-clenching).
Alternatives we balance: Jaw comfort strategies (/treatments/tmj-jaw-comfort); Support for anxious patients (/treatments/nervous-patients).
