Bone grafting for dental implants in Shoreham-by-Sea
Bone grafting can be used when there isn’t enough bone volume to place an implant in a stable, predictable position. The need for grafting depends on the site, how long the tooth has been missing, gum thickness, and the shape of the bone. We plan using CBCT imaging and digital scans to assess anatomy and map where the final tooth needs to sit, then discuss options such as minor grafting at implant placement or a staged approach where grafting is done first. We’ll explain healing times, how grafting affects treatment length, and what alternatives may be suitable if grafting isn’t ideal for your circumstances.

WHY BONE GRAFTING?
Create a stable foundation for implants
If bone height or width has reduced, adding graft material or lifting the sinus floor can give the implant a secure base. We recommend it only when scans show it will support long-term stability and comfort.

Digital planning that reduces surprises
We pair CBCT imaging with guided surgery principles so grafting and implant placement align. Digital impressions and lab coordination help restorations seat comfortably once healing is complete.

Bone grafting FAQs
Questions about grafting and sinus lifts
Do I often need bone grafting for implants?
No. We only recommend grafting when scans show there isn't enough bone to support an implant predictably.
What is a sinus lift?
A sinus lift gently raises the sinus floor and places graft material to create enough height for an implant near upper back teeth.
How long does grafting take to heal?
Healing times vary, but many grafts need several months before implant placement. We confirm your timeline after reviewing scans.
Can I have a temporary tooth while healing?
In many cases we can provide a provisional solution to maintain your smile while the graft heals.
Does grafting hurt?
Treatment is carried out with local anaesthetic and careful techniques; some soreness afterwards is normal and we support you with guidance.
What affects success?
Factors like smoking, diabetes control, and oral hygiene can influence healing. We tailor advice to your situation and monitor progress.
How much does it cost?
Costs depend on the type of grafting and number of implants. After assessment we share a clear plan with fees for each stage.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after implant consultation (/treatments/implants-consultation) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Appropriate when you want to find out when bone grafting is indicated to support implants.
Often follows Implant consultation (/treatments/implants-consultation); 3D scans (/treatments/cbct-3d-scanning).
Alternatives we balance: Sedation dentistry (/treatments/sedation-dentistry); Aftercare and hygiene (/treatments/implants-aftercare).
