Fixed braces
Predictable, clinician-led tooth straightening
Fixed braces move teeth using brackets and wires, offering a highly controlled way to correct alignment and bite problems. They can be a good choice where movements are more complex, where precise finishing is important, or where aligners are less suitable. We’ll assess gum health, enamel condition and bite forces before starting, then plan the sequence of movement and discuss expected timelines. During treatment, regular reviews allow adjustments to keep progress steady and safe. Retention is essential after braces, so we’ll explain retainers and long-term maintenance. If your goals include cosmetic refinements afterwards, we’ll help sequence whitening or bonding sensibly.

How fixed braces work
Planned movement with steady in-practice adjustments
Fixed braces use brackets and archwires to guide teeth into position. We plan the sequence, fit the braces, and review you regularly so movement stays on track and comfortable, while outlining how whitening (/treatments/teeth-whitening) or veneers (/treatments/veneers) can refine the smile once teeth are settled.

Bracket systems planned with scans and measured adjustments
We use scans or impressions to design bracket positioning and plan wire changes. Metal braces support efficient movement, while ceramic brackets may be offered for a lower-visual option where appropriate.

Fixed braces FAQs
Answers before you start
How long do fixed braces take?
Timing depends on your bite, tooth movement needed, and how often we adjust wires. We give a projected range at consultation and update you at reviews.
Can I choose ceramic brackets?
Ceramic brackets may be suitable for a lower-visual option. We'll explain benefits, limits, and whether they fit your treatment plan.
What does treatment cost?
Costs vary with case complexity, brace material, and appointment frequency. After assessing your teeth we provide a tailored estimate and payment options.
Will braces hurt?
You may feel pressure or rubbing after fittings or adjustments. Discomfort usually settles in a few days; we share comfort tips and can smooth or adjust wires if needed.
How do I clean around braces?
We'll show you brushes, floss options, and rinses that help you clean effectively around brackets and wires between visits.
What if a bracket comes loose?
Contact us quickly. We can advise short-term comfort steps and book you in to repair the bracket and check your wire sequence.
Do I need retainers after braces?
Yes. Retainers help keep results stable. We agree whether fixed, removable, or a combination suits you and how often to wear them.
