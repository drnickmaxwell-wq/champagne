Related care to explore
If sensitivity is the main issue, it can help to address the cause first — such as gum health, tooth wear, or hygiene care — then decide whether whitening still makes sense.

Know what to expect
Why can whitening feel sensitive?
Whitening gels can temporarily increase fluid movement within the tooth. We control gel strength and contact time to keep this minimal.
Can I still whiten if I already feel sensitivity?
Often yes, once we rule out decay or cracks. We may start slower, use desensitising support, and space applications further apart.
What should I do if I feel a zing?
Pause for a day or two and let us know. We can adjust frequency, recommend relief products, or review fit.

Sensitive teeth & whitening
Whitening with sensitivity in mind
If your teeth are sensitive, whitening may still be possible — but it needs careful planning and the right pacing. Sensitivity can come from exposed dentine, gum recession, enamel wear, micro-cracks, or underlying decay, so we start by identifying the cause rather than simply “pushing through”. We’ll talk you through lower-dose gels, shorter wear times, staged progress, and desensitising strategies to keep you comfortable. In some cases, addressing wear, bite stress or gum inflammation first makes whitening more predictable. If whitening isn’t the right option at the moment, we’ll explain alternatives and how to move towards it safely.
