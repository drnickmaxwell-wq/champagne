Clarity on keeping your shade
How often should I top-up?
Most patients refresh once or twice a year, often after hygiene visits. We tailor the schedule to your habits and starting shade.
Can I reuse my old trays?
Yes, provided the fit is still secure. We’ll check for wear or gaps before supplying gel.
Will I need stronger gel each time?
Usually not. We stick to safe, regulated strengths and keep to the smallest effective dose for your goals.

Whitening top-ups & maintenance
Keep your whitening results steady
Whitening top-ups are short booster phases used after an initial course to maintain brightness over time. The need for top-ups varies — it depends on your starting shade, diet, staining habits, and how long you’d like the result to stay at a particular level. We’ll explain sensible intervals and how to avoid overuse, because more gel isn’t necessarily better and can increase sensitivity. If you already have custom trays, we can advise on appropriate gels and protocols; if not, we’ll assess your teeth and gums first. We’ll also discuss how top-ups interact with existing crowns or composite edges to keep your smile looking even.
