TMJ & jaw care
Jaw joint problems, clenching, and facial pain
Problems involving the jaw joints (TMJ), clenching or grinding (bruxism), and facial muscle pain are common and often interconnected.

Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to persistent pain, headaches, or difficulty opening and closing the mouth.

At St Mary’s House Dental Care, these issues are approached carefully, with an emphasis on understanding causes rather than jumping to conclusions.

Understanding TMJ and bruxism
The temporomandibular joints (TMJ) allow the jaw to move smoothly during speaking, chewing, and swallowing.

Bruxism refers to clenching or grinding of the teeth, often occurring during sleep but sometimes during waking hours.

Muscle activity, bite factors, stress, and habits can all influence how these systems behave. Rarely is there a single cause.
