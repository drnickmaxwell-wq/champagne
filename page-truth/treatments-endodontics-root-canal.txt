Endodontics & root canal care
Root canal treatment
Root canal treatment is used when the nerve inside a tooth has become inflamed or infected.

The aim is to remove infection, seal the tooth, and keep it stable long-term — often avoiding the need for extraction.

We’ll assess the tooth carefully, explain what we can see (and what we can’t), and recommend the most predictable option for your situation.
Relieve pain and settle infection
Preserve the tooth where it’s sensible to do so
Restore strength with the right protection afterwards

Why root canal treatment may be needed
Why planning and precision matter
Root canal treatment is detail work.

Good outcomes depend on seeing the anatomy clearly, cleaning thoroughly, and sealing the tooth well. Sometimes canals are narrow, curved, or hard to locate — and that’s where careful technique and appropriate imaging help.

We’ll explain what we can see on the day and whether the tooth looks straightforward, complex, or uncertain — before we commit you to a plan.

Alternatives and limitations
Limitations and risks
Root canal treatment is usually very successful, but it isn’t magic.

Sometimes anatomy is complex, infection has been present for a long time, or cracks mean the tooth cannot be predictably saved. Occasionally a tooth needs further treatment later, even after an apparently good initial result.

We’ll talk through the realistic risks for your tooth specifically, and what the alternatives would be.
Success depends on anatomy, infection level, and tooth structure
Some teeth need follow-up treatment or referral if complexity is high
Cracks or severe breakdown can limit prognosis

=== SECTION: treatment_overview_rich ===
After root canal treatment
Aftercare and long-term outlook
Once the nerve is treated, the tooth still needs to be protected.

Back teeth in particular often need an onlay or crown afterwards because they’re more likely to fracture. A well-sealed, well-protected tooth can last many years, but maintenance matters.

We’ll recommend the simplest protection that gives the tooth the best chance of staying stable.
Follow-up checks are part of good endodontic care
Protecting the tooth afterwards is often the key to longevity
We plan for stability, not short-term patching

Questions and reassurance
Questions people ask
What if I’m unsure whether I need root canal treatment?
Root canal treatment should not be painful — the tooth is numbed thoroughly and we work carefully.

People often come in expecting the worst because they’re already in pain. In reality, the aim is to remove the source of that pain and make the tooth comfortable again.

If you’re anxious, tell us. We can pace the appointment, take breaks, and keep the plan simple.

Talk to us about root canal treatment
If you have toothache, lingering sensitivity, or swelling, it’s worth getting the tooth assessed.

We’ll explain what’s going on, whether the tooth is realistically savable, and what the next step should be — without pressure.

Endodontics & root canal care
Save painful teeth with calm, precise endodontics
Root canal treatment is used when the nerve inside a tooth is infected or inflamed. The aim is to remove infection, preserve the remaining tooth structure, and allow the tooth to stay functional rather than be lost.

We focus on accurate diagnosis, careful cleaning and sealing of the canals, and planning how the tooth will be protected afterwards so the result is predictable and maintainable.
Clear diagnosis to confirm when a root canal is the safest option
Gentle, well-anaesthetised care with careful rubber dam isolation
Restorations that seal the tooth and reduce the risk of reinfection
Plan a clinician-led endodontics root canal review
Consider alternatives like Crown restoration

Risks, limits & alternatives
Honest guidance before we start
We explain the chances of complex anatomy, existing cracks, or reinfection and when retreatment, surgical endodontics, or extraction may be safer. You’ll know the backup plan before consenting.
Discusses structural strength and whether a crown is needed
Explains limits of heavily cracked or previously treated teeth
Outlines alternatives such as monitoring, extraction, or implant replacement
Clear consent and documentation with realistic expectations

Longevity & prognosis
Protecting the tooth for the long term
Well-sealed canals and a protective restoration keep success rates high. We review healing radiographically and discuss maintenance to preserve the tooth for years.
Most treated teeth remain comfortable and functional for many years
Bite checks reduce the risk of fractures after treatment
Regular hygiene visits help prevent reinfection from new decay
If a tooth cannot be saved, we’ll plan extractions and future implant or bridge options

Root canal FAQs
Common questions about endodontic care
Will a root canal hurt?
Treatment is carried out under local anaesthetic with careful isolation. Most patients feel pressure rather than pain, and any post-treatment tenderness usually settles with simple pain relief.
How long does it take?
Many cases are completed in one to two visits depending on the number of canals and whether we need to place medication between appointments.
Do I always need a crown afterwards?
Back teeth or heavily restored teeth often benefit from a crown to prevent fractures. We will explain the best way to seal and protect your tooth.
What if the tooth can’t be saved?
We will outline alternatives such as extraction with healing guidance and future replacement options like bridges or implants if appropriate.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after emergency dental care (/treatments/extractions-and-oral-surgery) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Appropriate when you want to find out what root canal therapy involves and whether it is indicated.
Often follows Emergency dental care (/treatments/extractions-and-oral-surgery); Routine examinations (/treatments/preventative-and-general-dentistry).
Alternatives we balance: Sedation support (/treatments/sedation-dentistry); Hygiene maintenance (/treatments/preventative-and-general-dentistry).
Next steps we plan for: Crown restoration (/treatments/dental-crowns); Inlay or onlay repair (/treatments/inlays-onlays); Gum care follow-up (/treatments/periodontal-gum-care).
