About St Mary’s House Dental Care
St Mary’s House Dental Care is a long-established private dental practice in Shoreham-by-Sea.

We work in a calm, clinician-led way: careful assessment, clear explanation, and treatment planned for long-term stability rather than quick fixes.

If you’re nervous about dentistry, or you’ve had mixed experiences in the past, we’ll take things at a pace that feels manageable and explain what we’re doing as we go.

An independent practice by choice
How we work is simple, even if the dentistry isn’t.

We start with understanding the problem properly before talking about solutions. We explain options in plain English, including limits and trade-offs. Where it helps outcomes and costs, we plan treatment in stages. And we focus on comfort, fit, and long-term maintenance — not hype.

A practice built on relationships
The practice has been part of the Shoreham area for many years, and the building itself reflects that history.

Dentistry has changed a lot over time, but the principles haven’t: careful diagnosis, sensible planning, and work you can live with comfortably. We continue to improve how we assess, plan, and deliver care, while keeping the experience calm and straightforward.

Part of Shoreham, not just located in it
Good dentistry should feel understandable and unrushed.

Whether you need a simple check-up or more involved restorative work, our job is to help you make clear decisions you’ll still feel comfortable with in five and ten years’ time.
