Therapeutic injectable FAQs
Common questions
Is this the same as cosmetic toxin?
The medicine is similar but the intent and dosing differ. Here it is used to reduce muscle overactivity affecting comfort or function, not to change appearance.
How long do effects last?
Effects are temporary and reviewed regularly. Repeat dosing only happens when benefits outweigh risks and you remain clinically suitable.
Can I stop at any time?
Yes. Treatment is paused if you prefer, if symptoms settle with conservative care, or if side effects occur.
Who should avoid this treatment?
Patients with certain neuromuscular conditions, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or contraindicated medicines may not be suitable. We screen carefully before proceeding.
Do I still need a guard?
Often yes. Guards and self-care remain important to protect teeth and joints even when injectables are used.
