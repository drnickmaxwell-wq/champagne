Digital smile design FAQs
Previewing and choosing your plan
Will this lock me into a treatment?
No. It is a planning tool. We’ll outline options from conservative polishing to printed steps or porcelain, with pros and cons for each.
Can I try a physical mock-up?
Yes. We can print a try-in so you can feel contours and discuss refinements before any definitive work.
Does this work for implants or dentures?
It helps visualise implant restorations and denture shapes. We’ll still explain when lab ceramics or metal frameworks are required for durability.
How accurate is the preview?
It is based on your scans and photos. Final outcomes depend on chosen materials and clinical considerations, which we’ll review together.
What happens after the design?
You’ll receive a clear roadmap with timings, material recommendations, and fees so you can decide at your own pace.
