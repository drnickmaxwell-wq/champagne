What we make
Printed guides, provisionals, and protective devices
Our in-house lab produces restorative guides, try-in veneers, implant provisionals, dentures, and mouth guards under clinician oversight. Porcelain and lab ceramics remain the standard when long-term aesthetics and wear demand it.

3D printing lab FAQs
Safety, materials, and suitability
Are printed devices as strong as lab ceramics?
Printed materials are selected for specific indications and can be very durable. For certain long-term aesthetic or high-load cases, lab ceramics may still be recommended.
How fast can items be produced?
In-house control shortens turnaround. We share expected timelines and confirm when external lab work is needed.
Do you keep records of the designs?
Yes. We store digital files so remakes or adjustments follow the original plan without guesswork.
What materials do you use?
We use regulated dental-grade resins and materials suitable for their intended use and explain maintenance requirements.
Can I upgrade later?
Absolutely. We outline when transitioning to ceramic or metal alternatives benefits longevity or aesthetics.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after digital smile design (/treatments/digital-smile-design) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Appropriate when you want to see how in-house 3d printing supports models, guides, and provisional work.
Often follows Digital smile design (/treatments/digital-smile-design); 3D dentistry and technology (/treatments/3d-dentistry-and-technology).
Alternatives we balance: Digital implant planning (/treatments/3d-digital-dentistry); Implant consultation (/treatments/implants-consultation).
Next steps we plan for: 3D printed dentures (/treatments/3d-printed-dentures); 3D printed veneers (/treatments/3d-printed-veneers); Implant restorations (/treatments/3d-implant-restorations).
