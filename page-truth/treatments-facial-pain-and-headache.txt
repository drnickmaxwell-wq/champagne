Facial pain FAQs
Common questions
Do all facial pains need dental treatment?
Not necessarily. We identify whether the cause is dental, muscular, joint-related, or medical. If dentistry is unlikely to help, we signpost you to the right clinician.
Will I need scans?
Imaging is arranged when examination suggests joint changes, sinus involvement, or other causes that need further investigation.
What if I already wear a guard?
We review its fit and condition, adjust where needed, and update your plan if symptoms persist.
Are medicines prescribed?
Short courses or topical agents may be suggested when appropriate, but we focus on reversible measures first and coordinate with your GP if prescription medicines are needed.
When should I seek urgent care?
Escalate quickly if you notice swelling, fever, spreading redness, visual changes, or sudden difficulty opening your mouth.
