Jaw clenching & bruxism
Relief for clenching, grinding, and jaw fatigue
Grinding and clenching (bruxism) can place heavy forces on teeth, restorations and jaw joints, often without you realising. Common signs include tooth wear, fractures, sensitive teeth, morning headaches or jaw tension. We assess wear patterns, bite contacts and muscle tenderness, then discuss practical ways to reduce damage. A custom night guard is often recommended to protect teeth during sleep, and we’ll explain what it can and cannot do. Because bruxism is frequently linked to stress, sleep patterns or airway factors, ongoing review can be helpful if symptoms persist or are changing.

Bruxism FAQs
Common questions
Do all patients need a guard?
Not always. We only prescribe a guard when examination shows it will help protect teeth or joints. Some cases respond to self-care and lifestyle adjustments alone.
When are injectables considered?
Only after assessment and conservative steps. They may be offered to relax overactive muscles when clenching causes pain or wear and you are medically suitable.
How long does a guard last?
Lifespan depends on forces and care. We review wear and fit at follow-ups and can adjust or remake when needed.
Can bruxism damage other dental work?
Yes. We check crowns, implants, and fillings during assessment and plan protection to reduce the risk of fractures or loosening.
When should I seek urgent help?
If you experience sudden jaw locking, swelling, or severe pain, contact us or emergency services for urgent review.
