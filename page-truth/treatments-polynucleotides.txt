Polynucleotides consultation
Polynucleotides are used to support skin quality over time — often focusing on texture, hydration, and a healthier-looking finish rather than dramatic ‘instant’ change.

We’ll talk through your goals, assess what’s realistic, and recommend a plan only if it’s appropriate, subtle, and safe.

Polynucleotide treatments to support skin quality
Injectable polynucleotides used in staged courses to encourage skin regeneration and elasticity, offered only after clinical assessment.
Consultation-led suitability checks and informed consent
Protocols tailored to delicate areas such as under-eye skin when appropriate
Course plans with measured intervals and follow-up

Consultation & planning
Careful assessment before regenerative injectables
We review your medical history, medications, and skin health to confirm suitability. If appropriate, we outline how polynucleotides differ from skin boosters (/treatments/skin-boosters) or fillers (/treatments/dermal-fillers) and plan a course targeting areas that benefit from tissue support, such as periorbital or mid-face skin.
Contraindication screening and discussion of realistic expectations
Photography and mapping to monitor changes over the course
Clear spacing between sessions (often 2–4 weeks) to allow healing
Written aftercare and escalation guidance before the first session

Plan, deliver, review
Response varies by skin quality and lifestyle. We adapt spacing or pause treatment if your skin needs more time to settle.

Technique
Superficial delivery for gentle stimulation
Polynucleotides are placed in superficial planes with fine needles to spread evenly and minimise bulk. Depth, spacing, and product amount are recorded so future sessions can be adjusted accurately.

Polynucleotide FAQs
Common questions
How do polynucleotides work?
They are injectable biopolymers designed to support skin regeneration and hydration. We use regulated products and place them in superficial planes for gentle stimulation.
When will I notice changes?
Skin often feels more supple within weeks, with further improvements over a staged course. We review progress after each session.
Can I combine polynucleotides with other treatments?
Often yes, when sequenced carefully. We may pair them with anti-wrinkle care (/treatments/anti-wrinkle-treatments) or skin boosters (/treatments/skin-boosters) in separate appointments if clinically appropriate.
Are polynucleotides suitable for everyone?
No. We avoid treatment if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, unwell, or have skin infections. Suitability is confirmed during consultation.
What if I do not like the outcome?
Effects are gradual and course-based. We review after each session and can pause further treatment if expectations are not aligned.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after facial aesthetics consultation (/treatments/facial-aesthetics) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Appropriate when you want to explore polynucleotide treatments and their regenerative aims.
Often follows Facial aesthetics consultation (/treatments/facial-aesthetics); Routine skin health checks (/treatments/preventative-and-general-dentistry).
Alternatives we balance: Anti-wrinkle pathways (/treatments/anti-wrinkle-treatments); Dermal fillers (/treatments/dermal-fillers).
Next steps we plan for: Skin boosters (/treatments/skin-boosters); Polynucleotides (/treatments/polynucleotides); Therapeutic injectables (/treatments/therapeutic-facial-injectables).
