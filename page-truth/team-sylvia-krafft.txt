Credentials
Dr Krafft qualified as a Zahnarzt (Dental Surgeon) at the University of Cologne (Zahnklinik Köln) in 2001. In addition to her dental qualification, she is also a trained dental technician, giving her a detailed understanding of dental materials, morphology and precision.

Early in her career, she worked in general practice in Germany before moving to the United States, where she volunteered at a dental charity hospital in Miami. This experience reinforced her commitment to ethical, patient-centred care and to providing treatment that balances clinical need with individual circumstance.

Since moving to the UK in 2009, Dr Krafft has gained over 15 years’ experience across NHS and private dentistry. She has developed a particular interest in aesthetic dentistry delivered conservatively, focusing on proportion, harmony and tooth preservation rather than aggressive cosmetic change.

Her background as both clinician and technician informs a careful, detail-led approach, especially when planning aesthetic or restorative work. GDC: 174528.

Care philosophy
Dr Krafft’s clinical approach is centred on prevention, minimal intervention and patient understanding. She believes that aesthetic dentistry should enhance natural features rather than replace them, and that successful outcomes depend on respecting the biology of teeth and gums.

She prioritises conservative solutions wherever possible and takes time to explain options clearly, including what can be achieved predictably and what may introduce unnecessary risk. Patients are encouraged to make informed decisions at a pace that feels comfortable, with realistic expectations set from the outset.

For patients who feel anxious, Dr Krafft focuses on building trust through calm communication and a supportive, unhurried approach. Treatment is adapted to individual comfort levels, and patients are kept fully informed and in control throughout their care.

Her dual training as a dentist and dental technician supports a precise, considered approach to both aesthetic and functional treatment. Long-term oral health, stability and maintainability are always prioritised over short-term cosmetic change.
