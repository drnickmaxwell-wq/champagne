RECOVERY
What to expect after implant treatment
Most people notice expected swelling or soreness for a few days, move to gentle cleaning and a soft diet, and ease back into normal routines as tissues heal. Healing varies by individual and treatment type, and timelines for fitting final teeth can differ — we set clear steps so you know what’s coming.

Common questions about implant aftercare
How long does implant healing take?
Early settling often takes a couple of weeks, with deeper integration varying by case. We’ll outline your expected checkpoints and review dates.
What can I eat after implant surgery?
Start with soft, cool foods and avoid chewing directly on the implant site until we confirm it’s appropriate to progress.
How do I clean around the implant?
Use gentle brushing and any recommended brushes or rinses, keeping the area clean without disturbing the site. We’ll show you the technique.
Is swelling normal?
Mild swelling and soreness are common in the first few days. We’ll explain how to manage them and when to check in.
When can I exercise again?
Light activity is usually fine after a few days, but avoid strenuous exercise until we’ve confirmed healing is on track.
What if my bite feels high?
Temporary teeth can feel different at first. If your bite feels off or high, let us know so we can adjust it.
What are signs I should call the clinic?
Contact us if you notice persistent bleeding, increasing swelling, fever, severe pain, or an unusual taste or discharge.
How do I look after implants long term?
Attend routine reviews and cleans, follow tailored hygiene advice, and avoid habits that overload the area.
Do implants need special brushes or tools?
We may recommend interdental brushes, floss, or water flossers depending on your restoration. We’ll make it clear and simple.
Can I have sedation if I’m nervous about treatment?
If anxiety is a barrier, we can discuss sedation or other calming options before treatment so you feel supported.
