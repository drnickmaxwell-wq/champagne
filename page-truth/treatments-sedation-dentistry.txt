Sedation dentistry
Sedation support for calmer dental visits
Sedation can help patients who struggle with anxiety, a strong gag reflex, or longer procedures. It supports relaxation while you remain responsive and monitored throughout treatment. Sedation is not a substitute for good communication or local anaesthetic — it’s an additional tool used when appropriate. We assess suitability in advance by reviewing medical history and explaining what sedation can and cannot do. Safety and predictability are central, so sedation is planned rather than used routinely. If sedation is suitable, we’ll discuss preparation, aftercare and how it fits alongside the treatment you need.

How we decide together
Consultation, suitability, then a tailored plan
You’ll meet a clinician to discuss your concerns—anxiety, gag reflex, jaw tension, or the need for a longer visit. We review your health, medications, and previous experiences before advising on sedation or alternative calming support.
Medical history, airway, and medication review
Discuss when sedation helps—long treatments, complex care, or severe anxiety
Explain what to expect, including escorts and fasting if required
Share options for non-sedation support (calming environments, comfort tech like The Wand)
Agree next steps, including links to implant or emergency care if relevant

Sedation FAQs
Common questions answered
Is sedation right for everyone?
Not always. We review your medical history, medications, and needs first. If it isn’t suitable, we can use other calming support and comfort tech.
Will I be asleep?
Sedation aims to relax you while keeping you responsive. It is not general anaesthesia; you’ll be monitored throughout and recovery is supervised.
Can I use sedation for longer implant or restorative treatments?
Yes when appropriate. We’ll discuss suitability, coordination with your implant or complex care plan, and any extra recovery time.
What if I have a strong gag reflex?
Sedation can help reduce gagging, and we combine it with techniques like gentle numbing and paced breaks.
How should I prepare?
We provide written guidance on fasting (if needed), medication timing, and arranging an escort. You’ll also receive contact details if questions arise.

Appropriate when you want to understand sedation options available during dental treatment.
Often follows Nervous patient care (/treatments/nervous-patients); Oral surgery planning (/treatments/extractions-and-oral-surgery).
Alternatives we balance: Comfort-first numbing (/treatments/painless-numbing-the-wand); Aftercare planning (/treatments/implants-aftercare).
Next steps we plan for: Implant treatments with sedation (/treatments/implants-sedation); Teeth in a day pathways (/treatments/implants-teeth-in-a-day); Gum therapy support (/treatments/periodontal-gum-care).
