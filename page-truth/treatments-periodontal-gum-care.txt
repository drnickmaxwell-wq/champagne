Gum disease
Gum disease is a common condition that affects the tissues supporting the teeth.

It often develops gradually and may not cause pain in its early stages, which means it can progress unnoticed for some time.

At St Mary’s House Dental Care, gum disease is managed with a long-term view, focusing on understanding causes, stabilising the condition, and supporting ongoing oral health.

Understanding gum disease
What gum disease is
Gum disease occurs when bacteria build up around the teeth and gums, leading to inflammation and damage to the supporting tissues.

In its early form, known as gingivitis, the gums may bleed or appear swollen. If left untreated, it can progress to periodontitis, where bone and supporting structures are affected.

Not everyone progresses at the same rate, and severity varies between individuals.

Management and treatment
Treatment for gum disease focuses on reducing inflammation and controlling bacterial build-up.

This may involve professional cleaning, tailored oral hygiene advice, and regular monitoring.

Management is usually ongoing rather than a one-off intervention.

Periodontal FAQs
Answers to common gum care questions
Does deep cleaning hurt?
Treatment is planned gently with numbing gels or local anaesthetic where needed. You’ll be guided on what to expect and how to keep things comfortable afterwards.
How long does it take to see improvement?
Gums often look and feel healthier within weeks, but long-term stability depends on regular maintenance and the risk factors we identify together.
Can gum tissue grow back?
Inflammation can reduce and pockets can tighten with good care. Recession usually needs protective maintenance rather than regrowth, and we’ll discuss options if grafting or referral is appropriate.
What about implants with gum inflammation?
Peri-implant tissues can often be stabilised with careful cleaning, airflow-style stain removal, and close reviews. If advanced peri-implantitis is present, we’ll outline referral options calmly.

Periodontal & gum care
Calm, thorough gum care to steady teeth and implants
Gum care focuses on reducing inflammation and protecting the bone and tissues that support your teeth. Gum disease often progresses quietly, with bleeding, bad breath or tenderness as early signs. We assess gum pocket depths, bleeding points and contributing factors such as smoking, medical conditions and bite stress, then recommend care based on your risk level. Treatment may include targeted cleaning below the gum line and guidance on brushing and interdental cleaning that’s realistic to maintain at home. The aim is to stabilise the condition, keep gums comfortable and reduce the chance of long-term problems such as mobility or tooth loss.

Understanding gum disease
Gingivitis vs periodontitis
Gum disease starts when the gums don’t tolerate plaque as well as they used to.

At first, that often shows up as bleeding or tenderness. Over time, if the irritation continues, the support around the teeth can begin to change. That’s when stability becomes the main concern rather than just appearance or comfort.

Not everyone progresses at the same rate. Some mouths are resilient, others less so. That variation is exactly why careful assessment matters.
