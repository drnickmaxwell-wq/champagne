Clear answers before you start
Is dentist-led whitening safe?
Yes. We prescribe UK-compliant gels, design protective trays, and pace treatment so enamel stays healthy.
How long does treatment take?
Most plans take a few weeks of at-home use with review points. Timing depends on your starting shade and goals.
Will whitening change crowns or veneers?
Existing crowns, veneers, and fillings do not lighten. We plan around them and discuss refresh options if needed.

Teeth whitening
Teeth whitening in Shoreham-by-Sea
Teeth whitening lightens the natural colour of teeth using peroxide-based gels, most commonly with custom trays worn at home and, in selected cases, an in-practice approach. Whitening works best when teeth and gums are healthy, so we begin with an assessment to check for decay, leaking fillings, gum inflammation, and causes of sensitivity. We explain what shade change is realistic for your starting colour and how results can be maintained with appropriate top-ups. Whitening does not change the colour of crowns, veneers, or fillings, so we plan around existing dental work and discuss options if a more even overall result is needed.

Home whitening vs over-the-counter
Measured change with custom trays and follow-up
Teeth whitening is intended to lighten the natural colour of your teeth. It does not alter tooth structure; instead, it works by breaking down stains that have developed over time.

Results vary between individuals. Your starting shade, the type of staining present, and your overall oral health all influence how much lightening is possible.

Before starting, it is important to understand what whitening can and cannot achieve. A proper assessment helps confirm suitability and keeps expectations realistic.

Sensitivity management
Protocols that keep whitening comfortable
Professional whitening uses regulated gels that penetrate the tooth surface and break down stain molecules.

The tooth is lightened from within rather than by removing enamel. When used under dental supervision, whitening is a controlled and predictable treatment.

Over-the-counter products may appear similar, but under UK regulations they are limited in strength and effectiveness.

Whitening as part of ABC dentistry
Align → Bleach → Composite or veneers
Not everyone is suitable for teeth whitening.

Teeth and gums need to be healthy before treatment. Whitening does not change the colour of fillings, crowns, or veneers, which can affect the overall appearance if these are present on visible teeth.

We assess your oral health, existing dental work, and the cause of discolouration before recommending whitening. In some cases, alternative treatments may be more appropriate.
Aligners or orthodontics establish positions before shade work
Whitening locks in a natural shade to match future composites or veneers
Composite or porcelain is planned after bleaching to avoid re-making restorations
Review points keep the plan compliant and comfortable at every stage

Whitening questions
Safety, sensitivity, and longevity
Does whitening damage enamel?
Whitening does not remove enamel when it is carried out under dental supervision. We assess your teeth and gums first and use regulated gels to keep treatment controlled and safe.
Can whitening cause sensitivity?
Sensitivity can happen during whitening, but it is usually temporary. We adjust wear times, use desensitising products, and pause treatment if needed to keep things comfortable.
How long do results last?
Whitening results fade gradually over time and vary between people. We advise on habits that affect shade and discuss if or when a refresh might be appropriate.
