Consultation & planning
Skin-first assessment before treatment
We review skin health, hydration, and lifestyle factors to decide whether boosters are suitable. Where appropriate, we plan microinjections across cheeks, peri-oral areas, neck, or hands, and discuss how boosters differ from fillers (/treatments/dermal-fillers) or polynucleotides (/treatments/polynucleotides).
Medical history and skin examination to confirm suitability
Course design (typically two initial sessions 3–4 weeks apart)
Advice on pausing active skincare and planning around events

Plan, treat, review
Skin boosters build gradually. We do not rush sessions or stack products when the skin needs time to respond.

Technique
Microinjection patterns for even spread
We use fine needles and controlled depth to place microdroplets evenly, focusing on superficial planes to improve hydration without altering facial structure.

Skin booster FAQs
Common questions
How are boosters different from fillers?
Boosters are runnier, hydrating injectables that improve skin texture rather than adding volume. We avoid mixing them with volume-driven fillers in the same plane.
When will I see changes?
Most patients notice improved hydration and suppleness after the first sessions, with further gains after the second or third treatment.
Can they be combined with anti-wrinkle care?
Often yes, when staged safely. We sequence treatments so skin can settle and prescription medicines remain effective.
What if I have sensitive skin?
We assess barrier health first. If skin is inflamed or compromised, we may delay boosters and focus on repair before proceeding.
How long do results last?
Maintenance varies but top-ups are often recommended every few months once the initial course is complete.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after facial aesthetics consultation (/treatments/facial-aesthetics) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Appropriate when you want to learn how skin boosters can improve hydration and texture and whether they suit you.
