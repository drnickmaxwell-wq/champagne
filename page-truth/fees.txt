Fees and planning
Overview
Dental fees vary because treatment depends on the condition of the teeth and gums, the complexity of care, and the time and materials required.

Two people having what sounds like the same treatment may need very different levels of care.

Because of this, we avoid giving fixed prices without first seeing you.

How we approach fees
Before any treatment is started, we take time to understand what you actually need. This usually involves an examination, appropriate X-rays or scans, and a discussion about your priorities.

Where treatment is straightforward, fees can often be estimated quite accurately. For more complex or staged care, we will explain the likely range and the factors that could affect it.

You will always be given a written treatment plan before going ahead, and nothing is carried out without your agreement.

Why dentistry costs vary
If you are unsure whether a particular treatment is appropriate, or simply want to understand likely costs before booking, please get in touch.

Initial conversations are about understanding your situation, not committing you to treatment.

What our fees include
Our fees are not just for the treatment you receive on the day. They reflect the full clinical process, which may include:

• detailed assessment and diagnosis
• digital imaging and planning where appropriate
• high-quality materials and laboratory work
• time for careful, unhurried delivery
• follow-up care and review

This approach supports safe, well-planned care that is tailored to you — not simply completed quickly.

Staged treatment and flexible planning
Not all dental treatment needs to be done at once.

In many cases, care can be planned in stages, allowing you to prioritise what matters most and spread treatment over time. This approach often leads to better long-term outcomes and more manageable costs.

We are happy to talk through different options and help you decide what feels right for you.

Finance and affordability
Payment is usually taken at the time of treatment. For larger treatment plans, finance options may be available to help spread the cost.

If finance is something you would like to consider, we can explain how it works and whether it may be suitable for your situation.

We’ll always explain costs clearly before treatment starts, so you’re not faced with surprises.
