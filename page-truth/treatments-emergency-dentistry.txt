Emergency dentistry
If you’re in pain, have swelling, or you’ve damaged a tooth, the first job is to work out what’s urgent and what’s fixable — calmly.

Emergency care is usually about stabilising the situation: getting you comfortable, reducing risk, and planning the right longer-term repair.

If you’re unsure whether you need to be seen quickly, contact us and we’ll guide you.

How we handle dental emergencies
Introduction
Dental problems rarely arrive at a convenient time.

We’ll listen to what’s happening, ask a few focused questions, and advise whether it sounds urgent. If you need to be seen, we’ll aim to book the right type of appointment rather than squeeze you into the wrong slot.

If there are signs of a serious spreading infection (rapid facial swelling, fever, difficulty swallowing, or breathing problems), seek urgent medical help immediately (A&E / 999) and then let us know as soon as you can.

Common emergency situations
What you can expect at an emergency visit
We’ll focus on diagnosis and stabilisation.

That usually means an examination (and X-rays if needed), clear explanation of what we can see, and the least invasive step that reduces pain and risk. Sometimes that’s a temporary measure with a planned follow-up. Sometimes it’s a definitive repair — it depends on the tooth and the cause.

We’ll explain costs and options before anything starts, so you can make a clear decision under pressure.

After an emergency visit
Following emergency care, further treatment may be recommended to address the underlying cause.

We’ll explain any findings clearly and discuss whether monitoring, further investigation, or planned treatment is appropriate.

You’ll have time to consider options once the immediate situation has settled.

When urgent care may not be necessary
Some issues can wait a short time — for example, a small chip with no pain, a lost filling that isn’t sensitive, or mild sensitivity that settles quickly.

If you’re unsure, it’s still worth contacting us. We can help you work out whether it sounds urgent, and what to do while you’re waiting.
Questions and reassurance
If you’re anxious, tell us. We’ll take things step-by-step, explain what we’re doing, and keep the plan simple.

Emergency dentistry isn’t about pressure-selling or starting big treatment on the spot. It’s about getting you safe, comfortable, and clear on the next sensible step.

Introduction
How we handle dental emergencies
A dental emergency is any situation where pain, swelling, trauma, or infection needs prompt assessment.

Not all urgent dental problems look the same, and not all require the same response. Our role is to assess the situation, relieve pain where possible, and decide what treatment is needed to stabilise the problem safely.

If you are unsure whether your situation counts as an emergency, contacting the practice for advice is appropriate.

Common emergency situations
What you can expect at an emergency visit
Emergency dental care focuses on assessment, pain control, and stabilisation.

The aim is to address the immediate problem safely, then discuss longer-term treatment once the urgent issue has settled. In some cases, definitive treatment is not appropriate during an emergency visit.

We will explain findings clearly and outline any recommended follow-up care.
