Injection-moulded composite for guided precision
Injection moulded composite is a digitally planned approach to cosmetic bonding. We design the smile change first, create a custom guide, and deliver the composite through it so widths, edges, and symmetry follow the plan without unnecessary drilling.
Digitally designed smile plan agreed before treatment
Custom guide helps composite follow planned shapes
Minimal tooth preparation to keep treatment reversible

Digital design
Digitally planned, guide-delivered composite
We start with scans and photographs, map proposed changes with digital smile design, and share previews where helpful. A guide is produced from this plan so the composite is placed and finished against a defined blueprint, keeping the process controlled and repeatable while still relying on clinician judgement.
