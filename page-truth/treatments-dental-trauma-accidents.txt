Dental trauma can range from chipped enamel to displaced or loosened teeth, fractures, and injuries to gums or supporting bone. What matters most is prompt assessment: we check tooth stability, nerve response, bite changes and soft tissue injury, and take X-rays to rule out hidden fractures. Treatment might include smoothing or repairing a chip, splinting a tooth, dressing an exposed nerve, or planning follow-up care if the tooth’s nerve is at risk. We’ll also advise on pain control and what to avoid while the area heals. If a tooth has been knocked out, time is critical — see that page for immediate steps.

Trauma FAQs
Do I need X-rays after an accident?
We will advise after examining the area. Imaging helps check for fractures or root damage that are not visible.
What if a tooth feels loose?
Keep it clean, avoid wiggling it, and contact us. We may splint it to nearby teeth while it heals.
Can you help with mouth cuts?
Yes. We assess soft tissue injuries, clean the area, and advise if medical attention or stitches are needed.
