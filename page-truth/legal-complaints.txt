Raising concerns
Overview
If something hasn’t felt right, we want to know.

We take complaints seriously and we aim to resolve concerns fairly, calmly, and as quickly as possible.

If you feel able, please raise the issue with us directly first. Most concerns can be resolved promptly once we understand what has happened and what you’re worried about.

What this page covers
This page explains how to raise a concern or complaint about care you have received, and how we handle it.

It is not a substitute for clinical advice. If you have pain, swelling, trauma, or an urgent problem, please contact the practice so we can help you quickly.
Key points in plain English
- Tell us what happened and what outcome you’re hoping for.
- We will listen, review what we can, and respond clearly.
- If we need time to investigate properly, we will tell you the expected timescales.
- You can raise concerns in writing, by email, or by speaking to the team.
Your choices and controls
You can bring someone with you to support you if you prefer.

If you would like your complaint handled by a specific person, let us know and we will do our best to accommodate this, depending on availability and the nature of the concern.

We keep complaints confidential and handle them in line with professional and legal obligations.
How to contact us
The best first step is to contact the practice directly so we can understand the issue and try to resolve it.

If you prefer to put things in writing, email is often the clearest way to set out what happened and what you would like us to do next.
