THE CONSULTATION
What happens at an implant consultation?
We assess your mouth, dental history, and medical factors, carry out imaging or CBCT scans if indicated, and map options such as single implants, implant-retained dentures, or full-arch approaches — including staged versus same-day routes where suitable. The focus is understanding and planning, not rushing into treatment.

Common questions about implant consultations
Am I suitable for dental implants?
Suitability is confirmed after a full assessment, including scans where needed, so recommendations match your health and goals.
Do I need a CBCT scan?
A CBCT scan is recommended when it improves safety and planning clarity; we explain why before proceeding.
How long does implant treatment take?
Timelines depend on healing, bone quality, and the type of restoration. We outline likely stages after your assessment.
Can I have sedation if I’m nervous?
Sedation options can be discussed and assessed for suitability. We prioritise calm, no-pressure planning.
What are the alternatives to implants?
If implants aren’t high standards fit, we talk through alternatives such as bridges or dentures so you can choose confidently.
Can I have temporary teeth while healing?
Interim solutions may be possible depending on your plan. We cover options during consultation and planning.
How long do implants last?
Implants are intended as long-term solutions, but longevity depends on bone health, home care, and attending reviews.
How much does an implant consultation cost?
Fees are confirmed after we understand your needs and any scans required, with transparent estimates provided in writing.
Will I get a written plan?
Yes. After assessment you receive a personalised plan with options, timelines, and costs to review at your own pace.
What happens after the consultation?
You have time to consider the plan. If you proceed, we schedule treatment and guide you through preparation and aftercare.
