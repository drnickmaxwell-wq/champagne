Our team
Dentistry works best when it’s delivered by people who know each other well.

At St Mary’s House Dental Care, we’re a small, experienced team who work together every day — not a rotating cast. That continuity matters. It affects communication, planning, and how calmly care is delivered.

Patients often tell us they value recognising familiar faces and feeling understood rather than processed.

How we work together
Good outcomes in dentistry depend on more than individual skill.

They rely on clear communication between clinicians and nurses, shared standards of care, and consistency in how patients are looked after. Our team works closely across examinations, hygiene, restorative care, and longer-term treatment planning.

That collaboration reduces errors, avoids duplication, and makes appointments feel more settled.

Nursing and support staff
Support team
Dental nurses and support staff play a central role in patient care.

They are often the first point of contact, the calm presence during treatment, and the continuity between visits. Many of our nurses have worked here for years and know patients well.

Their role includes supporting clinicians during treatment, helping patients feel comfortable and informed, and maintaining high standards of organisation and infection control.
Joanna Dobson oversees the day-to-day running of the practice, supporting patients with clear communication and a calm, organised approach that helps visits feel smooth and well-coordinated.
Riz Deen supports patients through complex treatment planning, helping them understand options clearly and feel comfortable making decisions that fit their needs.
Gill Bentley leads the nursing team with a calm, organised approach, supporting patient care while maintaining consistently high clinical and infection-control standards.
Sophia Ball supports patients both at reception and in surgery, helping visits feel calm, informed and well-coordinated through clear communication and reassurance.
Molly Pearce supports patients with a calm, detail-focused approach, helping appointments feel steady and well supported, particularly for nervous patients.
Marianne Fawbert supports patients at reception, helping appointments run smoothly through careful organisation and clear, helpful communication.
