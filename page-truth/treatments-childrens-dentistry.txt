Children’s dentistry FAQs
Answers for parents
When should my child first visit?
We’re happy to see children as soon as their first teeth appear or by their first birthday. Early visits help them get used to the chair and let us spot any early issues.
How often should they come?
Most children benefit from 6-monthly check-ups, but we may recommend shorter intervals if decay risk is higher or longer if everything is very stable.
Do baby teeth really matter?
Yes. Healthy baby teeth guide adult teeth into place, support speech, and allow comfortable eating. Protecting them reduces the risk of pain, infection, or early tooth loss.
What if my child is scared?
Tell us ahead of time and we’ll keep visits short, use tell-show-do, and let them stay in control. We can build up gradually with positive language and plenty of breaks.

Children’s dentistry
Gentle check-ups that build lifelong habits
Children’s dentistry is centred on prevention, early diagnosis and helping children feel comfortable in the dental setting. We keep appointments calm and age-appropriate, taking time to explain what we’re doing in a way that builds confidence rather than fear. Regular reviews allow us to monitor tooth development, bite changes and oral hygiene as children grow. We also give practical advice on diet, fluoride use, brushing and habits such as thumb sucking, which can affect long-term oral health. If treatment is needed, we plan it carefully with comfort and cooperation in mind, so visits remain manageable and positive.
