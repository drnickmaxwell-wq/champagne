How we work
Scan → Design → Print/Mill → Fit
Your pathway is mapped in advance: we capture a precise scan, design collaboratively, produce the restoration in-house, and refine it chairside with the clinician who planned it.

What we can make in-house
Precision outputs, clinician-reviewed
We design and fabricate 3D printed veneers (a conservative, cost-effective option with porcelain still the longevity gold standard), implant restorations with planned torque and maintenance, characterised dentures, digitally designed mouth guards, and digitally planned inlays/onlays—all produced under the treating clinician's oversight.

Digital dentistry FAQs
Answers before you choose
When do you recommend porcelain instead of printing?
We recommend porcelain for cases needing maximum longevity, high gloss, or colour stability. Printed options are useful for provisional stages or conservative veneers when appropriate.
How fast can printed dentures or guards be ready?
Digital scanning and in-house production shorten turnaround times; we share a range after your assessment and schedule fit appointments accordingly.
Do printed implant restorations need different maintenance?
We pair them with occlusion checks, hygiene plans, and torque reviews. You’ll know the follow-up cadence before treatment begins.
Can designs be adjusted after I see the preview?
Yes. We review shape, bite, and shade options with you, then adjust the plan before production.
What about repairs or remakes?
Digital files let us reproduce or adjust quickly if needed, with clinician review to avoid repeating issues.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after routine care (/treatments/preventative-and-general-dentistry) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Appropriate when you want to understand how digital tools support diagnosis and treatment planning across dentistry.
Often follows Routine care (/treatments/preventative-and-general-dentistry); Implant consultation (/treatments/implants-consultation).
Alternatives we balance: 3D implant restorations (/treatments/3d-implant-restorations); Aligner planning (/treatments/aligners).
Next steps we plan for: CBCT scanning (/treatments/cbct-3d-scanning); Digital smile design (/treatments/digital-smile-design); 3D printing lab (/treatments/3d-printing-lab).
