Remote guidance with a clinician
A video consultation can be a calm first step if you’d like clinical guidance before coming into the practice.

It works well for discussing symptoms, reviewing your history, talking through options, and planning what would be most useful to do in person. If something needs a hands-on examination, X-rays or scans, we’ll be clear about that and help you book the right appointment.

A video consultation is not designed for emergencies, significant swelling, trauma, or situations where you may need urgent clinical care. In those cases, please call us so we can advise promptly.
