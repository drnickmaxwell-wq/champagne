What they are
Reinforcement without removing healthy structure
Inlays and onlays are custom restorations that sit within or over the biting surface of a tooth. They stabilise weakened areas while preserving more natural enamel than a full crown.
Ideal for larger cavities where a filling may not hold
Designed to restore strength and shape
Custom-made to fit your bite and contact points
Bonded for stability and easier cleaning
Planned digitally for predictable seating

Clinician-led planning
Conservative restorations delivered with restorative training
Our clinicians use postgraduate restorative techniques and digital design to decide whether an inlay or onlay will best reinforce your tooth. Margins, contacts, and bite guidance are mapped before fabrication to support predictable seating.
Assessment includes crack risk, remaining tooth, and bite forces
Restorations planned from scans to refine margins and contacts
Material selection tailored to the bite and location
Appointments scheduled to allow thorough try-in and adjustments

Inlay & onlay FAQs
What to know before you proceed
Who is suitable for an inlay or onlay?
They are best for teeth with larger cavities or failing fillings where enough healthy structure remains. We will advise if a crown, repair, or monitoring is safer.
What are the alternatives if I am not suitable?
Depending on the tooth, options may include a bonded filling, a crown for full coverage, or smoothing and monitoring. We explain why each choice would or would not work for your bite.
How long do inlays and onlays last?
Longevity varies with bite forces, material, and cleaning. We choose ceramics or composites suited to your tooth and review the fit at check-ups to catch wear early.
How do I look after the restoration?
Daily cleaning around the margins and attending reviews keeps the tooth and gums healthy. Avoid very hard foods on the tooth while it settles, and let us adjust the bite if it feels high.
What are the risks or limitations?
Restorations can debond or chip if forces are heavy or hygiene is poor. We assess crack lines and grinding habits beforehand and may recommend a protective splint if needed.
How are inlays and onlays priced?
Fees reflect material choice, lab fabrication, and the planning needed for your case. We provide a written estimate before treatment and discuss phased care if appropriate.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after routine check-ups (/treatments/preventative-and-general-dentistry) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Appropriate when you want to learn when inlays or onlays are recommended and how they differ from fillings or crowns.
Often follows Routine check-ups (/treatments/preventative-and-general-dentistry); Bite and wear review (/treatments/bruxism-and-jaw-clenching).
Alternatives we balance: Gum health support (/treatments/periodontal-gum-care); Digital smile planning (/treatments/digital-smile-design); Managing bite forces (/treatments/bruxism-and-jaw-clenching).
Next steps we plan for: Crown restoration if needed (/treatments/dental-crowns); Occlusal splint for protection (/treatments/night-guards-occlusal-splints); Smile refinement (/treatments/veneers).
