Guidance from your dentist
How long will I wear the trays each day?
Most patients whiten for a set period each evening based on the prescribed gel. We’ll agree the exact cadence with you.
What if my teeth feel sensitive?
Tell us and pause for a day or two. We can adjust frequency, provide desensitising gel, or modify the plan.
Can I whiten if I have bonding or crowns?
Yes, but those materials will not lighten. We plan whitening first and discuss refreshing restorations afterwards if needed.

Home teeth whitening
Custom home whitening with dentist oversight
Home whitening uses custom-made trays and professional whitening gel to gradually brighten your teeth in a controlled way. The benefit of the home approach is precision: the trays are tailored to your teeth, the gel is used in measured doses, and you can pace treatment to manage sensitivity. We’ll check your teeth and gums first, because untreated decay, gum disease or exposed roots can make whitening uncomfortable and unpredictable. If you have existing restorations on the front teeth, we’ll explain how whitening affects the natural tooth but not the restorations, and how we can plan any replacements afterwards if needed for a balanced look.
