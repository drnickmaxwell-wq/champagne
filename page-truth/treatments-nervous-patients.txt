Nervous patients
If you feel anxious about dentistry, you’re not alone — and you don’t need to ‘push through it’ to get help.

We take a calm, practical approach: clear explanations, gentle pacing, and treatment planned in stages when that makes things easier.

Sometimes the best first appointment is simply a conversation and an examination. We’ll agree a plan together — with comfort and control built in from the start.

What to expect
We’ll start by understanding what makes dentistry difficult for you. That might be a specific fear (needles, numbness, drilling), sensory overload, a past experience, or simply not knowing what’s going to happen.

Depending on your needs, we can:
- go at a slower pace, with breaks
- agree a clear ‘stop’ signal so you stay in control
- explain each step before we do it
- stage care so it feels manageable rather than overwhelming

If sedation is relevant, we can explain when it may be appropriate and what it involves. Not everyone needs it — for many people, pacing and predictability are the biggest difference.
A calm, non-judgemental conversation first
An examination (and X-rays only if needed)
Clear options and costs explained before treatment
A staged plan that fits your tolerance and goals

Nervous about dental treatment?
Feeling anxious about dental visits is extremely common — and it shows up in different ways.

Some people feel tense before appointments. Others avoid booking altogether. Some cope until something hurts, then worry about what they’ll be told. None of that is unusual, and none of it needs justifying.

At St Mary’s House Dental Care, we take dental anxiety seriously — without making it the centre of the appointment.

Pace and control
Taking things at your pace
For nervous patients, treatment doesn’t have to happen all at once.

In many cases, it helps to start with a conversation or examination only, break treatment into shorter appointments, stabilise problems before addressing everything, and build familiarity with the team and environment.

You stay in control of the pace. Nothing is rushed by default.

Support options when anxiety is significant
For some people, extra support helps — longer appointments, staged planning, or sedation where appropriate, assessed carefully.

Comfort and control
Pain control and comfort
Modern dentistry allows for effective pain control when treatment is needed.

We’ll always discuss what you’re likely to feel, how discomfort is managed, when numbness is used, and what to expect afterwards.

If something doesn’t feel right, we stop and adjust. Comfort is part of good care.
