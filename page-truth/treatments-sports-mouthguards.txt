Sports mouthguards
Custom sports mouthguards for confident play
Sports mouthguards reduce the risk of chipped teeth, fractures, jaw injuries and soft tissue trauma during contact or high-impact sports. A custom-made guard is shaped to your bite so it stays in place, allows breathing and speaking more easily, and distributes impact forces more effectively than shop-bought options. We take impressions or digital scans, discuss thickness and sport-specific requirements, and ensure the fit is comfortable and secure. Mouthguards should be checked periodically, especially for younger patients or if teeth move over time. The goal is simple: reduce the chance of avoidable dental trauma during play.

FAQs
Sports mouthguard questions answered
Can you make guards for children?
Yes. We tailor designs to growing mouths and advise when replacements are sensible as teeth move or erupt.
How often should I replace my guard?
Replacement intervals depend on wear and growth. We review your guard at check-ups and plan updates before protection drops.
Are these suitable over braces?
We design lab-made guards to accommodate brackets or aligners, balancing coverage with space to avoid unwanted pressure.
