Implants for several missing teeth
Replacing several missing teeth
When more than one tooth is missing, the choices become broader — and the planning becomes more important.

Multiple teeth can be replaced using individual implants, implants supporting a bridge, or implant-retained removable solutions. The right option depends on how many teeth are missing, where they are, and how your bite functions.

What are multi-tooth implants?
Implant foundations that lock bridges in place
Two or more titanium posts are carefully placed to anchor a bridge or partial denture, replacing several teeth with a stable, natural-feeling result that spreads chewing forces evenly.

Multi-tooth implant FAQs
Common questions about replacing several teeth
How many implants do I need for multiple missing teeth?
Several missing teeth can often be replaced using a smaller number of implants that support an implant-supported bridge or denture.

The exact approach depends on the number of teeth missing, their position, and how forces are distributed when you bite.
What is the timeline for multi-tooth implants?
We share a clear schedule from planning and placement through healing to the final bridge, with provisional options if needed to keep you chewing.
Will I be without teeth during healing?
We can often provide a temporary bridge or partial denture so you can smile and eat softer foods while the implants integrate.
Is it better than a traditional bridge?
Implant-supported bridges avoid drilling healthy neighbouring teeth and give more stability for chewing, while helping maintain bone.
How do I clean around an implant-supported bridge?
We demonstrate brushing and floss aids or interdental brushes to clean under the bridge and around the implant posts.
Does it hurt to place multiple implants?
Placement uses local anaesthetic with gentle techniques; expect pressure and some soreness afterwards, managed with our aftercare plan.

Alternatives and staging
Replacing several teeth is a significant decision.

Clear explanation and staged planning help ensure the approach chosen fits your health, comfort, and long-term needs.

There’s rarely a single ‘right’ answer — the aim is to find the option that makes sense for you.
