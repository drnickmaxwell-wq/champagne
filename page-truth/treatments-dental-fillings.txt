Dental fillings
Fillings are among the most common dental treatments, but when they’re done well they rely on careful judgement rather than routine work.

A filling repairs a tooth affected by decay, wear, or fracture, restoring strength and function and reducing the risk of further breakdown.

At St Mary’s House Dental Care, we take a conservative approach, protecting healthy tooth structure and focusing on longevity rather than short-term fixes.

Material options
Types of filling materials
Different materials can be used for fillings, and the most suitable choice depends on which tooth is involved, where it sits in the mouth, and the forces it needs to withstand.

We’ll talk through the benefits and limitations of each option, how noticeable it may be, how durable it is likely to be, and any alternatives that may be worth considering.

Alternatives
When a filling may not be enough
A filling is not always the most reliable long-term option, particularly when a tooth has been significantly weakened.

If that applies, we may discuss options such as an onlay or crown, and explain the reasons clearly so you understand the trade-offs involved.

Supportive care
Keeping the restored tooth healthy
Regular hygiene visits and good gum care help keep the margins clean and reduce the risk of new decay developing around a filling.

We set maintenance intervals based on gum health, any clenching or grinding, and diet-related risks.

FAQs
Questions about dental fillings
When is amalgam better than composite?
We consider amalgam when a tooth carries heavy biting forces, when it is difficult to keep the area dry during placement, or when longevity is the main priority. Where appropriate, we bond amalgam to improve strength and the seal.
How long will sensitivity last?
Mild sensitivity to temperature or biting can last for a few days. Let us know if it continues beyond a week, or if the pain is severe or wakes you at night.
What happens during the appointment?
We numb the tooth where needed, isolate it, remove decay or any failing material, then place and bond the filling. We shape and polish it carefully and check your bite before you leave.
When do you recommend an onlay or crown?
If there isn’t enough healthy tooth left for a filling to hold securely, we may recommend an onlay or crown to support the tooth and create a more reliable seal.
