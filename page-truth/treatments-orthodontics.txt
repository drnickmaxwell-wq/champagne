Orthodontics
Orthodontic treatment
Orthodontic treatment focuses on improving how teeth are positioned, how they function together, and how they’re supported over time.

While many people associate orthodontics with straightening teeth for appearance, alignment can also play an important role in comfort, bite stability, tooth wear, and long-term oral health.

At St Mary’s House Dental Care, orthodontic treatment is approached as part of a wider plan — not as a one-size-fits-all solution.

When orthodontics may not be the right answer
Orthodontic treatment isn’t always appropriate.

In some cases, alternatives such as monitoring, restorative treatment, or a more limited approach may be better suited. If orthodontics isn’t likely to offer meaningful benefit, we’ll be open about that and explain why.

Orthodontic FAQs
Questions about orthodontic treatment
Why might orthodontic treatment be recommended?
Orthodontics may be considered when tooth position or bite contributes to crowding, spacing, bite imbalance, difficulty cleaning, or excessive wear.
Is orthodontic treatment only for teenagers?
No. Many adults choose orthodontics later in life to address long-standing concerns or to support function and stability.
What types of orthodontic treatment are available?
Options may include clear aligners, fixed appliances, or limited treatment focused on specific areas. Suitability depends on individual circumstances.
How long does orthodontic treatment take?
Timescales vary depending on complexity, appliance type, and how teeth respond. We’ll give you a realistic estimate before starting.
Will I need retainers after treatment?
Yes. Retainers help maintain the result and reduce the risk of teeth drifting over time.
