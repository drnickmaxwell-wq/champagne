How we work
Scan → Design → Print/Mill → Fit
3D and digital dentistry refers to the way we plan, design, and carry out dental treatment using detailed digital scans rather than relying only on traditional impressions and estimates.

For patients, this means we can see your teeth, bite, and jaw in far greater detail before treatment starts. Digital scans allow us to plan carefully, explain options clearly, and reduce guesswork at every stage.

This technology supports safer planning, clearer communication, and more predictable outcomes. It does not replace clinical judgement or experience — it supports it.

Clear checkpoints from scan to maintenance
Timelines vary by case complexity; we share ranges and review points upfront.

What we can make in-house
Precision outputs, clinician-reviewed
Instead of taking physical moulds, we use digital scanners and imaging to build a precise three-dimensional picture of your teeth and mouth.

These scans are used to plan treatments such as crowns, implants, aligners, or complex restorations. Because the information is visual, we can show you what we see and talk through options in a way that is easier to understand.

Digital planning helps us check spacing, bite relationships, and fit before treatment begins, rather than discovering issues part-way through.

Digital dentistry FAQs
Answers before you choose
When do you recommend porcelain instead of printing?
We recommend porcelain for cases needing maximum longevity, high gloss, or colour stability. Printed options are useful for provisional stages or conservative veneers when appropriate.
How fast can printed dentures or guards be ready?
Digital scanning and in-house production shorten turnaround times; we share a range after your assessment and schedule fit appointments accordingly.
Do printed implant restorations need different maintenance?
We pair them with occlusion checks, hygiene plans, and torque reviews. You’ll know the follow-up cadence before treatment begins.
Can designs be adjusted after I see the preview?
Yes. We review shape, bite, and shade options with you, then adjust the plan before production.
What about repairs or remakes?
Digital files let us reproduce or adjust quickly if needed, with clinician review to avoid repeating issues.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after routine care (/treatments/preventative-and-general-dentistry) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Appropriate when you want to learn how 3d digital workflows shape assessments and restorative planning.
Often follows Routine care (/treatments/preventative-and-general-dentistry); Implant consultation (/treatments/implants-consultation).
Alternatives we balance: 3D implant restorations (/treatments/3d-implant-restorations); Aligner planning (/treatments/aligners).
Next steps we plan for: CBCT scanning (/treatments/cbct-3d-scanning); Digital smile design (/treatments/digital-smile-design); 3D printing lab (/treatments/3d-printing-lab).
