A conservative route to refined change
Introduction
Veneers are thin restorations placed on the front surface of teeth to refine shape, colour and alignment. They can be an excellent option when the teeth underneath are healthy enough, and when the plan is conservative and carefully staged. We start by understanding what you’d like to change, then assess enamel, bite, gum health and wear patterns so the result is stable and maintainable. In many cases, we can explore minimal-prep or additive approaches, or consider alternatives such as whitening, bonding, or aligners first. If veneers are suitable, we’ll talk through preview options, longevity factors and how to protect the finished work.

How veneers work
Porcelain and composite veneers with measured preparation
Veneers are thin restorations that refine shape, shade, and symmetry. Porcelain veneers are made in the lab for strength and longevity; composite veneers are crafted directly and can be adjusted over time. We keep claims conservative and only recommend veneers when they are the safest option for your teeth.

Minimal-prep or no-prep approaches considered when enamel allows
Not a whitening shortcut — some discolouration needs other care

How veneers are planned
Face-driven, digital planning before any tooth changes
Digital Smile Design, intraoral scanning, and calibrated photographs guide every case so veneer shapes follow your face, bite, and speech. Trial smiles or printed previews are offered when it helps you feel confident about proportion and shade.
Digital Smile Design mock-ups aligned to your midline and lip dynamics (/treatments/digital-smile-design)
Intraoral scans to measure enamel thickness, contacts, and bite pathways
Face-driven aesthetics that balance tooth width, gingival levels, and phonetics
Trial smiles or provisional previews to test length and volume before committing
Sequencing with our whitening hub before shade matching if needed (/treatments/teeth-whitening)
Alternatives such as composite bonding for minor refinements when safer (/treatments/composite-bonding)

Materials & craftsmanship
Laboratory porcelain and regulated printed resins
Porcelain veneers are hand-layered in the lab with staining, characterisation, and glazing that suit your neighbouring teeth. Printed or milled options use FDA-cleared and CE-marked resins, then are hand finished chairside for gum harmony, bite integration, and a natural sheen.

Veneer FAQs
Answers before you commit
How long do veneers last?
Longevity depends on material, bite forces, and maintenance. Porcelain can offer many stable years with night guard protection and reviews; digitally designed or composite-style veneers may need refreshes or upgrades sooner.
How much do veneers cost?
Costs vary by material and complexity. Printed or composite-style options are the most affordable, while handcrafted porcelain reflects lab artistry and longevity. We outline options and payment plans before you commit.
Am I suitable for veneers?
Suitability depends on gum health, enamel thickness, bite, and habits. We may recommend whitening, composite bonding, orthodontics, or a full smile makeover instead if coverage is not the safest choice.
What maintenance do veneers need?
Routine hygiene, non-abrasive home care, and wearing a night guard if you clench all extend veneer life. Printed or composite-style veneers may need more frequent polishing or planned replacement; porcelain benefits from the same protective habits.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after smile design planning (/treatments/digital-smile-design) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Appropriate when you want to understand veneer options, suitability, and maintenance.
Often follows Smile design planning (/treatments/digital-smile-design); Orthodontic alignment (/treatments/orthodontics).
Alternatives we balance: Aligner refinements (/treatments/aligners); Gum contouring and care (/treatments/periodontal-gum-care).
Next steps we plan for: Protect with night guards (/treatments/night-guards-occlusal-splints); Finishing whitening (/treatments/whitening-top-ups); Regular reviews (/treatments/preventative-and-general-dentistry).
