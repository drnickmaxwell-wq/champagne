Strength, function, and maintainability
Introduction
A dental crown is a protective restoration that covers and strengthens a tooth that is heavily filled, cracked, worn down, or has had root canal treatment. The goal is to restore function and protect the remaining tooth structure, while keeping the bite comfortable and the margins clean and maintainable. We plan crowns using a full assessment and digital scans so we can check contact points, bite forces and appearance before anything is finalised. Where appropriate, we’ll discuss onlays or adhesive options that preserve more natural tooth. If a crown is recommended, we’ll explain materials, preparation, and how to look after it.

Dental crowns
A dental crown is used when a tooth needs more protection than a filling can provide.

Crowns are most often recommended for teeth that are heavily worn, cracked, weakened, or have already had extensive treatment. The aim is to protect what remains of the tooth and help it function comfortably for the long term.

At St Mary’s House Dental Care, crowns are planned carefully, not routinely.

Our approach
Our approach to crowns
Crowns aren’t just about covering a tooth.

We focus on preserving as much natural tooth as possible, choosing designs that support the tooth rather than over-cutting it, planning the bite carefully to reduce stress, and aiming for longevity rather than quick cosmetic fixes.

Digital planning
Scans that guide fit, bite, and appearance
Intraoral scans capture your bite and neighbouring teeth so the lab can produce a crown with clean margins, comfortable contacts, and a shade that blends. This reduces chairside adjustments and helps the crown feel natural from the first fit.

Alternatives
When a crown isn’t the best option
Crowns aren’t always the answer.

In some situations, alternatives such as fillings, onlays, or monitoring may be more appropriate. If we think a crown isn’t the best long-term solution, we’ll explain our reasoning clearly.

Dental crown FAQs
What to expect from crown treatment
Who is a suitable candidate for a crown?
Crowns are recommended when a tooth is cracked, heavily filled, or needs reinforcement after root canal treatment. If a more conservative option is viable, we will explain that first.
Are there alternatives to a crown?
Depending on remaining tooth structure, options may include an onlay, bonded repair, or monitoring. We map crack risk and bite forces to advise when full coverage is the safer route.
How long will my crown last?
Durability depends on bite forces, hygiene, and material. We choose ceramics or metal-ceramic options to suit your case and schedule reviews to check margins and contacts over time.
What maintenance does a crown need?
Clean carefully around the margins and attend regular hygiene appointments. Bite checks help us refine contacts and spot early signs of wear or gum inflammation.
What are the risks or limitations?
Crowns can chip, loosen, or develop decay at the margins if hygiene or bite balance is poor. We plan coverage height and consider splints if grinding is present to reduce these risks.
How are crowns priced?
Fees vary by material, laboratory input, and any additional planning such as scan-guided design. We provide a written estimate and outline phased treatment if needed.
Will the crown match my other teeth?
We shade-map your neighbouring teeth and use digital scans to guide shape and translucency. The aim is a natural blend that suits your smile and gumline.

Decision clarity
When this fits and what else to consider
In our clinic we usually stage this after root canal therapy (/treatments/endodontics-root-canal) so the plan stays safe and measured.
Appropriate when you want to learn when crowns are recommended and what the process involves.
Often follows Root canal therapy (/treatments/endodontics-root-canal); Tooth wear repairs (/treatments/inlays-onlays).
Alternatives we balance: Gum stability (/treatments/periodontal-gum-care); Smile design planning (/treatments/digital-smile-design); Managing clenching and grinding (/treatments/bruxism-and-jaw-clenching).
Next steps we plan for: Routine maintenance (/treatments/preventative-and-general-dentistry); Whitening after restoration (/treatments/teeth-whitening); Night guards for protection (/treatments/night-guards-occlusal-splints).
