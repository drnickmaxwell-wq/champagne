Night guards (occlusal splints)
Night guards and occlusal splints
Night guards and occlusal splints are custom-made appliances designed to protect teeth and reduce strain on the jaw.

They’re commonly used where tooth wear, clenching, grinding, or jaw discomfort is present, and where doing nothing may allow problems to progress.

At St Mary’s House Dental Care, splints are used thoughtfully — as part of understanding and managing forces, not as a one-size-fits-all solution.

What to expect during treatment
Night guards and occlusal splints are used to protect teeth and manage risk when the bite is under strain.

They don’t “cure” grinding or clenching. Their role is more practical than that: to reduce damage, improve comfort, and help keep things stable over time when forces are higher than the teeth can comfortably tolerate.

Used appropriately, they form part of a longer-term management plan rather than a one-off fix.
We’ll take impressions or digital scans to ensure an accurate fit.
We’ll explain how and when to wear it, how to clean it, and what to expect initially.
Review appointments allow us to check comfort, fit, and effectiveness.

Our approach to splint therapy
Splints are most effective when they’re properly planned and reviewed.

We focus on careful assessment, accurate records, and follow-up to make sure the splint is doing what it’s intended to do. Adjustments may be needed over time as symptoms change or improve.

A splint is not usually a ‘fit once and forget’ device.

Questions and next steps
Night guards are a management tool, not a permanent solution to the cause of grinding.

They need to be checked periodically, as both the appliance and the bite can change over time. Wear on the guard often tells us useful information about ongoing forces.

In some cases, additional treatment or investigation is needed. In others, long-term use of a well-maintained appliance is an effective way of protecting the teeth and supporting comfort.
If you’re unsure whether a night guard or splint is necessary, we encourage you to ask.
Understanding why an appliance has been recommended — and what it can and can’t achieve — is key to making an informed decision.

FAQs
Night guard questions answered
Will a night guard stop grinding?
A night guard protects the teeth and helps manage damage from grinding, but it does not cure the habit itself. We use it as part of a longer-term management plan.
Are there alternatives if I do not want a splint?
Management may include exercises, habit coaching, or muscle therapies, but a splint is often the safest way to protect teeth and dental work from night-time forces. We will outline all options.
How long will my splint last?
Durability depends on grinding forces, material choice, and care. We monitor wear at reviews and advise when replacement is needed without making fixed promises.
How do I look after the splint?
Rinse and brush it gently after use, store it in a ventilated case, and avoid heat. Bring it to appointments so we can clean and adjust it, especially if your bite changes.
What are the risks or limitations?
Splints can feel tight or cause tenderness if contacts are uneven; adjustments resolve this. Wear or cracks may occur with heavy grinding, so periodic review is important.
How are night guards priced?
Fees reflect the material, lab or in-house production, and the complexity of your bite. We provide a written estimate and discuss phased care if repairs or replacements are anticipated.
Will it affect speech or breathing?
Most people adapt quickly. We refine the fit and thickness to keep speech clear and breathing unobstructed.

When a splint may not be enough
In some cases, a splint alone isn’t sufficient to address underlying problems.

If tooth wear is advanced, if there are structural issues with the bite, or if symptoms persist, further investigation or treatment may be needed. We’ll explain these findings clearly and discuss appropriate next steps.
