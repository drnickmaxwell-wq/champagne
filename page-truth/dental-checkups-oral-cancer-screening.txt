How often to book
Most people stay on track with 6-monthly visits. If you have higher decay or gum risk, recent treatment, or are in active orthodontic care, we may agree a shorter cadence. We explain any recommendations so you know why timing matters.

FAQ
Questions about check-ups
Do I need x-rays every time?
Not always. We follow clinical guidance and your risk profile to decide when x-rays are useful. We will explain the reason, dose, and what we are looking for before taking them.
Will you tell me if you see anything concerning?
Yes. We talk you through any changes, explain what is normal, and outline next steps if we spot something that needs a closer look.
How long does a routine exam take?
Allow around 30 minutes so we can review your mouth carefully, capture notes or images, and leave time for your questions.
Can I combine a check-up with hygiene?
Often yes. We can align appointments so you have your check-up and hygiene visit together when schedules allow.
