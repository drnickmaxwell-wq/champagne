Facial aesthetics FAQs
Common questions
Do I need a prescription for anti-wrinkle treatment?
Yes. A prescriber assesses you first, confirms suitability, and issues a prescription before treatment.
Can I combine treatments?
Only when clinically appropriate and sequenced safely. We explain how treatments interact, what maintenance looks like, and when to stage or avoid combinations.
What if I’m not suitable?
We will explain why and may recommend skincare, dental care, or no treatment. There is no pressure to proceed.
How do you manage risks?
We use regulated products, aseptic technique, and have emergency protocols, including dissolving agents for filler-related complications.
