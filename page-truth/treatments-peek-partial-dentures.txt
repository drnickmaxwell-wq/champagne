What they are
Metal-free partials with a natural feel
PEEK dentures use a tooth-coloured polymer framework instead of metal. We design clasp shapes, tooth positions, and bite with you, then test comfort before finishing so you know how the material behaves.
Assessment of supporting teeth, gums, and bite
Framework planning to keep bulk low while staying strong
Try-ins to check speech and smile line
Discussion of shade matching for clasps and teeth
Guidance on when acrylic or chrome may be better

Materials & fit
Metal-free support with balanced flexibility
PEEK frameworks are strong yet slightly flexible, helping clasps hug teeth gently. We tune bite, polish contact points, and explain how adhesives or implant support could help if you want even more stability.

FAQs
Understanding PEEK partials
How does PEEK feel compared to metal?
It feels warm and lightweight with no metal taste. We still plan a settling-in period and review points for adjustments.
Can PEEK clasps be tooth coloured?
Yes. We colour-match clasps where possible so they blend with neighbouring teeth.
Is PEEK as strong as chrome?
PEEK is strong but slightly flexible. It suits many partials, but for very heavy bites or minimal tooth support we may advise chrome or another approach.
What if I want more stability later?
We can revisit fit, add a soft liner, or discuss implant support if you’d like even less movement. Each step is paced around comfort and healing.
